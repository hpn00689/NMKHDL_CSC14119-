0,The Future of Nintendo Handhelds?,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update (Feb. 12, 2020):I originally gave this product 5 stars because the excitement of a brand-new handheld Nintendo console had not yet worn off. Now that I've been using it for a few months, there are a few things I take issue with.The first issue I've noticed is that the eShop is PAINFULLY slow compared to other devices. I understand that the Switch is behind other consoles in general, but I think there's an issue when it can run Minecraft (a CPU-intensive game) better than it can run the eShop. I know that in my original review I said that the eShop lag wasn't too bad, but it can be at times. I really don't see the reason for this. I mean, it's not a smooth experience at all. The icons take a while to load sometimes and if I scroll too fast I have to wait for it to catch up. It's the same thing when I switch between the menus, too. And no, it's not my WiFi.Now, the other issue I have is the home screen. On the 3DS, you could customize the icons however you wanted, you could put things in folders, and you could even have really cool themes! With the Switch, you don't get any of this. You get a dark mode and a light mode. That's it.Now, if you don't care about these features that's fine, but I personally like having the option to personalize my devices. Also, it's painful having to scroll through the games you have installed on your switch because the icons are so large and you can't make them stay where you want them. It's just really clunky and annoying.Another thing is if you're looking to you're looking to use your Switch for anything other than playing games, you're out of luck. There is no internet browser and no streaming apps. There is a YouTube app, but it's kind of bare-bones and you can't look at comments on videos.So, for these reasons I had to knock off a star from my review. The only reason I didn't remove more stars is because I still believe the Switch is a great system with a lot of potential. I still believe that Nintendo should continue with this idea and I hope that they take people's criticism into consideration.Oh, and this isn't really the SL's fault, but the screen is pretty small so certain games can be hard to play on it because it can be hard to see certain parts of the UI. Just something to look out for.Also, I know some people have already been experiencing JoyCon drift with this console, but I personally haven't had a problem with it yet.Original Review (Oct. 2019)I really, REALLY love this system.I don't own the original Nintendo Switch, and I got the Lite because of the lower price point and the lovely colors. I also wanted to play a lot of the games that are on the Switch, but not the 3DS. I was going to wait for the Zacian and Zamazenta edition to come out, but I decided I liked the turquoise edition better and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.Now that I have it, I must say that I am very pleased with its performance. It runs faster than I expected from a system that is so small. I haven't noticed any severe lag (although it does lag a little bit if I go through the eShop categories too fast).Speaking of size, the Switch Lite is perfect. It's just big enough that I can see the screen just fine, but not too big that it's uncomfortable to hold. Keep in mind that I am someone with fairly small hands, so a person with larger hands may find the buttons and joysticks to be too close/cramped for their liking.The screen resolution is one of the highlights of this system. Compared to my 3DS XL, the screen is fantastic. Seriously, I didn't realize how bad the 3DS screen is until I compared it with this system. All the games look amazing, especially Super Mario Bros. U. Mario Kart 8 also looks great.Another thing I like a lot is the form factor. I like that everything I need to see is just on one screen and that the buttons right there beside it. It's not that I don't like the clam-shell design of the DS line, it's just that this form factor feels more comfortable to me. Of course, the form factor does come with its downsides. For example, it's going to be a lot easier to scratch the screen and the buttons. But that can be remedied if you just get a screen protector and a case to put it in.Another thing I like is that it comes with a charger. It seems like a no-brainer to put something to charge the device in with the packaging of the device itself, but guess what? When I got my 3DS, I had to buy the charger separately. Just another way for Nintendo to get money out of me, I guess. Luckily they did not make the same mistake with the Switch Lite. I also like that the cable on the charger is so long. It makes it easier for me to charge it and play it at the same time because I can get comfortable without worrying about holding my Switch in an awkward position.Although there are a ton of positives about the Switch Lite, I do have one complaint. My screen came with a stuck pixel. That really annoys me, but because it's kind of a light green/white I can't really see it when I'm playing games unless I'm specifically looking for it on the screen. I can only really see it when I'm in the eShop. It does suck though that an otherwise perfect system would have a flaw that can really be annoying at times. And anyway, Nintendo has said that it's a common issue with the screens so I don't expect that they would do much about it anyway.I was pretty disappointed when I figured out that the DS line of systems is pretty much dead now, but after buying the Switch Lite I'm kind of excited for the future of Nintendo handheld systems. I hope that they come out with more colors for the Lite and I also hope they expand upon this system like they did with the DS line.Overall, I think this system is a drastic improvement upon the DS line, but beware of stuck pixels and the fact that Nintendo does not seem to care about them."
1,Excellent portable.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first handheld since the original Game Boy. I really enjoy my Switch Lite. The eShop is chock full of incredible titles and I'm very impressed at the game selection. From Doom Eternal and classic Quake to Animal Crossing and Chess, the entire spectrum of genres is covered on Nintendo's hardware. It's black magic how this thing can even run some of these 3rd party AAA games. The games play great and I'm impressed at the performance of 3rd party AAA titles. Doom Eternal doesn't run near as good as on my Xbox One S, but I'm impressed how the developers were able to still cram the entire game into this comparatively lightweight hardware. My Switch Lite is very easily pocketable (even with protective case) and I have an excellent protective case for it; the LeyuSmart Protector Case with HD Tempered Glass Screen Protector (https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B08PBNGWJP?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_image) which I have also reviewed. I run most of my games off a 1TB microSD card and they run perfectly fine, with slightly increased load times, of course, but as a lifelong console gamer, I'm very used to that. For the value of $199, this thing packs a punch out of nowhere and you'll be hard pressed to find a better value among the plethora of portables available nowadays; at least until the arrival of Steam Deck (which is an worse than an apples to oranges comparison, hardware and game library wise - Nintendo does things their own way, they're in a league of their own and they do and excellent job at it).I'm always a fan of the fading 3.5MM headphone jack on any modern hardware, and Nintendo being the ""Apple"" of console gaming hardware, they could have easily omitted it, forcing players to use the USB-C port to jack in a set of earbuds or headphones, but thankfully, they kept it old school. I was pleasantly surprised to see that you can indeed, use the USB-C port to play through a wired headset that way, if you choose (in order for me to use my headset to it's fullest, I unfortunately have to attach the USB dongle which contains the volume controls, so this is very helpful, especially if I play online and voice chat, although the mute and cut mic buttons don't seem to register on the Switch Lite). I'm willing to bet that you could get Ethernet over USB-C with one of the cheap, $15-$20 USB-C to Ethernet adaptors on Amazon to hardline in for faster game downloads (or smoother online multiplayer, if you feel like having it hang from your Switch the whole session) rather than buy the official Nintendo endorsed one, which is overpriced and probably won't fit on that dock with the case I have on my switch, anyway. I plan on purchasing one and will update my review on the experience when I do.I love how you can remap the button and stick assignments in system settings; ensuring that I can play some games using my beloved ""Southpaw"" controller layout (not sure why it's called that, should be the opposite). I was in a doctor's office playing it and somebody remarked they couldn't play on the ""small screen"", but it's fine for me; compared to the regular Switch, I don't have Joy Con rails to worry about breaking like on my son's Switch (he's already on his fourth pair).Nintendo has this thing locked down. You can't customize your home screen (I was hoping for some Android-style customization, here), organize your games, pass messages to friends and Nintendo (again, doing things their own way) seems hesitant to allow other third party apps on it like Prime Video, VLC (I'd love to be able to watch my videos and listen to my music on it), Twitch, Discord, Facebook or Amazon. It is also lacking a basic web browser and there doesn't appear to be a mic built in anywhere; speech to text would have been a nice alternative to smudging your screen or clumsily typing with the buttons and D-pad. I'm a little surprised there aren't any rumble motors it or something for at least a little feedback. Photo sharing to smartphones is very difficult to get working and I end up having to upload my screenshots to Facebook and download them to my phone as a workaround. Unnecessary. There is no review system on the eShop, so you have to look at third party review sites like metacritic before you purchase your games. The speakers are weak, my Pixel 4a has better sound. Another drawback is the lack of a lock; anybody can come along and grab or steal your Switch and have full access to everything on it including buying games on the eShop. The charger that comes with it (while being the tempting USB-C form factor) will ONLY charge a Switch and will instantly short out if you attempt charging any other device with it - I found this out the hard way. I replaced it with a far superior 3rd party option that charges anything.Overall, great hardware with some minor flaws and I plan on getting a pink one for my daughter, which I'm sure she'll enjoy as much as I do."
2,I’m glad I have one; I hate I bought one.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nintendo must be raking in a lot of cash right now because they are selling hardware with a chip that nearing a decade in age. The net code for online games is clearly from the X360era, I jest not (with Mario Kart being the sole exception in my experience). Moreover, you have to spend money to use this infrastructure but the blame lies entirely on Microsoft for standardizing that. The analog stick drift is still an issue with this “budget” revision of the original.Despite all that, I decided to purchase this machine. Why? Gameplay-driven games or just games.  Nintendo clearly only has this one thing going on for them and that is they make excellent games, for the most part. If it’s something by their EPD division or Retro Studios, you’ll be in for a treat. However, everything else, especially the third-party games are massively inferior compared to the versions on the competitors’ hardware while having to pay more for those games, something which is commonly referred to as the “Nintendo tax” by the gaming community.People have been calling this a neat little machine for indie games. However, now that the Steam Deck is out and the wait times have been cut down significantly, I’d recommend that over this. But what about the difference in price you may ask. To that I say the games are cheaper on Steam and it really adds up on the Switch and before you know it, you’ll very likely have spent more money with the Switch than on the Deck. If you care about physical releases though then avoid the Deck.There are definitely some things I really like about the Switch. For one, I can now play games while lying on my bed. I can play games in the short breaks I take. I can swap out the physical games I own without much effort (I wish I could hot swap the SD card as well but as of right now, the OS doesn’t support it. Steam Deck does, however, so it likely is not a technical limitation.)As a new owner, you may have to get used to the form factor because the thing is very tiny and also quite light. This device is clearly designed for smaller hands. If your hands are big, then I’d highly recommend getting a feel for it in a brick and mortar store before purchasing one. I remember my first week with this thing cramping my hands playing Mario. But you eventually get used to it.The OS software is serviceable. They have made many additions since launch but it still remains quite minimal, a bit too minimal in my opinion.This Lite variant doesn’t have Joy-Cons so the D-pad on this console is now something that a human being can actually use.I like that I can play Zelda wherever I want. However, I hate the fact that I have contributed to encourage Nintendo to do what they’ve been doing with their Switch line-up.In short, it’s a neat little device that I wish wasn't priced this way and didn’t come with the annoyances that come with Nintendo hardware."
3,Very fun and addicting,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Nintendo switch lite. I am very thankful I was able to get one. Never had one ever in my life and never had any video games at all during my childhood. This Nintendo came and it was easy to set up. No damage. Created my account. The colors and video quality is good. It took my new storage space card easily. No problems at all so far. I have purchased a few games and they are all fun!! ""secretly addicting"" so beware! Yes I know I could have bought the Nintendo switch oled but the price is cheaper and I am not familiar with on how to play games on my TV, and my TV isn't that big either."
4,"everything works wonderfully, but not packaged in the best way",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really enjoyed this product. The controls make the game relatively easy to play, the console's design is sleek and easy to hold, and the Nintendo store gives you access to free games even if you don't get an external game. I was able to get both Dauntless and Overwatch 2 on the console for no extra charge. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the packaging. I had it will some other things I had purchased, and there was no cushion around the console. Given how the screen is glass, I was not hopeful about opening the switch box, but it pulled through. So besides the packaging, This is a fantastic product and I look forward to getting more games for my switch!"
5,Best handheld console ever,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best handheld console by far.  I chose the lite over the original due to its portability.  Big surprise was when I saw a car instead of the usual Amazon van in front of the gate, then I saw an Amazon carrier drop off the package.  Way better than running super mario 3d world on the yuzu emulator, and could not run super mario bros u deluxe nor dkc tropical freeze on yuzu.  Loading times are much faster, so no more concerns.  While it took me 2.5 months to collect all 380 green stars and 85 stamps, I expect to duplicate this in well under two months.  Way cheaper than the Xbox series x, which I was gonna purchase to run FH 4 and 5, but able to run them both on my laptop.  The price should be 500 or less, but last time I checked, was close to 800."
6,Fast shipping and delivery!,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s going to be a Christmas gift. It was shipped and delivered quickly! I only turned it on to set up the account and insert the game I am also giving as a gift. It’s perfect! Will update if anything changes once it’s actually being used after Christmas :)
7,"No issues, runs as it should",5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical of the quality at first but this system works perfectly with no issues
8,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so happy and shocked how B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L the coral is, I thought I wouldn't like it but it's like a pastel pink. It was very easy to set up and I absolutely loved my purchase"
9,Great game console,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Brand new, in the box, Nintendo switch lite game console! The kids love it!"
10,My son bday present,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son love his gift then and now and it was worth the money spent
11,just what i wanted,5.0 out of 5 stars,i liked it
12,Great fun,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my son. It was alittle cheaper because it's yellow. My son plays it almost everyday.
13,A bit of joy to a couple of Gen X-ers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My girlfriend and I are both in our 40's, and neither of us have owned any modern (post 2000) game console. For me it was a Super Nintendo, for her an N64. I borrowed a Nintendo Wii from a friend and loved it, but I never bought one. We just wanted something handheld that you can play the old school games on. I've had my eye on a Switch Lite for a while, and finally purchased one a couple of weeks ago. I don't know the technical ins and outs of modern consoles, so I'm just going to keep my mouth shut there; but after an easy setup, this has been a ton of fun for both of us. I would like to ease my way into newer games, I just became uninterested in video games from my teenage years to recently, so nearly 30 years in this particular realm of technology has largely passed me by. But like I said, my girlfriend and I have been having a lot of fun reliving the 80's and early 90's with this. So if you're looking for the same experience, definitely pick one of these up."
14,"A nice handheld - just too big, and battery life still isn't good enough",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used my original Switch probably 80% of the time in handheld mode since I got it, so a smaller version that's handheld-only and with better battery life seemed a no-brainer to me. The original Switch isn't really powerful enough to compete with the other home consoles, but as a handheld it's huuuuuuge, and has really poor battery life. So I was actually excited for a handheld-only version - while I like the idea of a hybrid system and feel it was executed pretty well for a first attempt, I just think a more focused handheld-only Switch should be able to do the thing the system is already best at even better.And generally, the Switch Lite does. It's better built than the original Switch - it doesn't show fingerprints, it doesn't flex or bend, and it just generally feels really solid. It also has a proper Nintendo-style d-pad, which I know is important for some people. The screen is also a tad bit brighter.The weird thing is that it's not that much smaller than the original Switch, and battery life isn't much better either. Both of these things should have been priorities in a handheld-only device. Compared to the 3DS or even 3DS XL, this thing is massive. And as far as battery life goes, I only get about 4 hours. These are both the kinds of things people pointed to for handhelds like the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear failing in the marketplace! The Switch Lite is almost as wide as an Atari Lynx II, and has about the same battery life.The main justification for the size that I've heard is that it has to play games that are meant to be played on a big screen TV, so the screen can't really be that small. But first, the Switch Lite still has some pretty big screen bezels - as big as the PS Vita, a much older handheld. They could have reduced the system's size without further reducing screen size. But second, this is a dedicated handheld. I don't want compromises; I want a handheld. If you want a system with a big screen that can be used to play those big-screen games, get an original Switch! It can be used as either a big-screen system or a handheld; that's why it still exists. For a *dedicated* handheld, I want a small system that I can put in my pocket. I want a system designed as a handheld, not as something slightly smaller than the home version of the system.In other words, there's just not quite enough differentiation between the Switch and Switch Lite in terms of its handheld capabilities, so it's a little hard to recommend this to someone who already has a Switch (like me). It's just not going to be all that much different when carrying it around and using it in handheld mode. That's especially true if you have the ""new"" original Switch (the one that comes in the red box) with its 1-2 hours of extra battery life. In that case, there's really no justification for buying this unless you want to play games simultaneously with your wife or kids.But if you don't have a Switch, and you don't care about hooking up to your TV, then this is definitely the most powerful handheld ever released. It's also cheaper than the original Switch, better built and a bit smaller, so if you're only planning on playing in handheld mode, you may as well get this.But I hope Nintendo keeps iterating (and they usually do) and this is not the last version of the Switch Lite. They really need to get it down to about the size of the 3DS XL, and with 10-12 hours of battery life. Then it'll be a 5 star handheld."
15,PARENTS BEWARE: This could be useless to you too!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gave it 5 stars because there is nothing wrong as described, but parents may want to read this:I have two kids and we already own the original Nintendo Switch and have amassed over 40 games throughout the 2.5 years since the Switch's release. The Switch Lite although nothing physically wrong with it, is completely useless to me and my family. I have two young kids, and all 3 of us have our own profiles which are linked under my main account via Nintendo ID. The problem is is that only the main account holder (me) can play the purchased games on both devices. So the Switch Lite does not work for either of my kids, only my main account. Yes, this can be switched by changing which Switch device is the ""primary"" switch, but the fact still remains that under NO conditions can my kids play both switch consoles at the same time, even if it is two separate games. If you have cartridges instead of digital downloads, you will not have this problem. I just fail to understand Nintendo's logic with this. I understand that they are trying to protect their own content from unauthorized use, but in doing so are rendering their newest device completely useless to customers like me. I will be returning."
16,A fave item in my house,5.0 out of 5 stars,My kids still play with this even years later and it works just as well as when I bought it new
17,What kid wouldn’t want this Switch?,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What a big hit! My grandson, age 7, loves his Nintendo Switch! It was packed well and he had no problem setting up his user ID and off he went to playing games!"
18,Pretty great came fast,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ordered my switch on a Friday and it came on Wednesday so it came pretty quick I also saw a lot of reviews saying it didn’t come with a charger well it does so now I have 2 chargers for my switch
19,Muy chevere,5.0 out of 5 stars,Me encanto
20,handheld switch,4.0 out of 5 stars,very convenient for travel play
21,Great Nintendo Console,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best Nintendo Console ever made❤️🙂👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️👍👍
22,So far so good! Works great,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything works as it should & been going since April now
23,I love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only thing I wish is that I could connect to my TV.  Otherwise great buy!
24,Too pricey the analog stick is messed up,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fun system tho everything cost
25,Good on the go system,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Came really quick but, I don't know if it was my screen protector or not but there were some small scratches on the screen at least I think I am not entirely sure. Either way, still a good console and no matter how much you try to coddle it, there will be wear and tare. I definitely recommend this system though especially, if you don't have time to really sit down a lot."
26,An amazing handheld device even in 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's now the best time to buy the switch lite. There are a ton of games on the eshop with discounts on a daily basis. Runs smooth (at least to my eyes) I am mainly playing MH rise and there is no issue even in multiplayer. This device is so convenient if you are a busy person, you can easily play while on break and just put it to sleep when you go back to work and when you turn it back on you will continue where you left of, I was surprise with this feature a game changer for me since I only like to play for a couple of minutes at a time. A must buy for your self or as a gift."
27,The Switch lite is great for small kids.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful color and the kids love it. Seems to work great.
28,Great to distract wife,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wife hates me playing video games. Got her this and she loved it and is okay with me gaming.
29,My daughter loves it,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is just what my daughter was looking for. She is playing it nonstop.
30,Good value!,5.0 out of 5 stars,We bought this for our 10 year old granddaughter Christmas 2021. She’s not a gamer but loves this device and the Animal Crossing game that we bought with it. Nearly 8 months later and she still plays on it regularly.The one negative Is that there are not enough compatible games for this device that are wholesome. Animal Crossing is relatively innocuous but has some elements that are disturbing for young kids.
31,great used condition,5.0 out of 5 stars,great used condition
32,It’s so PRETTY 😭,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I ordered this morning and it’s already HERE! Perfect condition! 💓 definitely PINK! And sd card was there too! It’s so B I G ! The screen is so clear and all buttons work great. Thank y’all so much this was my bday present from hubby! 😁"
33,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good switch.
34,Received it on time and works great!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Glad I got it, it’s fun to play with and works great, also it came on time."
35,"It’s a Nintendo, what more do you need to know?",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay but seriously, I only caved and bought this when my Gameboy Advance finally broke after life happened one too many times to it.This wasn’t my first choice for color, it’s an orangey-pink coral. But it works great, the battery holds up so far and it charges quickly. It will not, however, hold an entire library worth of games so if you flit from title to title like I do? Do yourself a favor and buy a high capacity SD card. Completely worth it for my ADHD self. Especially if you have a penchant for the games with more detailed graphics.The Switch Lite does not, on that subject, have the greatest graphics itself. But it does look good, plays good, is nice and portable and checks all the boxes in general for what I wanted in a handheld.Here’s to hoping that it survives as well as its predecessors."
36,Long car ride saver,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Kept the kid busy for the long wait time and car rides, would recommend for grocery shopping trips too."
37,Great for kids but Nintendo account sharing is a nightmare,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter absolutely loves her lite.  The device itself is amazing and great for travel.  There are a few downsides like not being able to dock, and some games like just dance won't work.  If you want to use it for a travel or just for standard games like Zelda and Mario this is amazing.The reason that I am giving the product 3 starts instead of 5 is all due to the family sharing.  Many will use the lite as a secondary device.  This is at least what my family has done.  We purchased a switch a few years ago for the family and for Christmas  our daughter really wanted to have her own.  We have a family account so the whole family can use the applications on the family switch and the kids do not need to use my account.  This would you think work similarly for the 2nd switch but that is not the case at all.  The ability to use the games on the second switch is possible but the standard way is terrible, and that is completely on Nintendo.The setup that we have that works is thisFamily switch is primary console and my account is primaryAll games are bought on this console digitally through my accounteveryone in the family can play and game on this switch and can dock and play as well on their profilessecondary switch is using my profile as the main and it needs to be online to play any gamescannot use any other profile on the switch because I am the owner of the gamesboth of my kids can play at the same time the same game but need to be on my profile on lite and their profile on switchI know that Nintendo wants users to buy multiple copies of the games to play, but my kids accounts do no t have payment methods and we did not want to have a lot of disks lying around.  We put in 512GB cards so that we would not need to worry about space.If Nintendo could allow family sharing allow every switch in your house play every game locally even if it is only 1 person can play the game at a time this would be amazing.  As it stands now family sharing is killing the usability.  I can play the same game on my PS4 and PS5.  I can also do it on my xbox one and series x.  Nintendo needs to match what all of the other platforms are doing for as much as you spend on these consoles and games you should be able to play them without needing to jump through a ton of hoops."
38,Finally a true Vita replacement,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was ecstatic when the first switch was announced two years ago. I've always loved the feeling of gaming on a handheld device, having grown up with the Gameboy, Gameboy color and Gameboy advance. Years later the PSP and Vita garnered my attention.Console gaming on a TV has its place, as does gaming on a PC. However, there is something that just feels more intimate about a handheld device you can play while sitting on the couch in a relaxed position. Or even more being able to take the experience with you and combat the total boredom of a three hour layover at the airport, followed by another half day in a cramped airplane.I had a switch since it's initial release and while it offered a good experience as a handheld it still lacked something compared to the Gameboy and Playstation devices. Breath of the wild on the go felt like a step in the right direction. But I feel as if the steps were impacted by heavy boots, an awkward and somewhat uncomfortable delivery for the experience.I'm not saying that the switch was a bad design but it was far from ideal given my expectations. Over the past two years my switch never went into the dock to display on my TV, it resigned to a dedicated handheld that eventually lapsed into a distraction only to be used while traveling. The awkward flex of the joycons mixed with the weight and size of the switch let me down a little. But for occasional use I could see past the flaws.Now, onto the switch lite. Immediately after unboxing and holding the device I could tell that this is what I had wanted in the switch two years ago. The weight is well balanced as my hands sit naturally onto the controls and there is no flex when gripping firmly. It's reminiscent of the Vita in all of the best ways. Only this time there's a game library that provides adequate variety.My first impressions could be tainted by the paired release of Link's Awakening, which is wonderful I might add. Finally, I found myself fully engulfed in gaming on the switch. It was like reliving my childhood, spending hours with my Gameboy in my grasp on the very same title.As expected, my hands didn't cramp after a half hour of use like they would with the original switch. The battery held sufficient charge to stay away from the outlet on the other side of my couch for hours on end as well. In my eyes it is perfect in every possibly way as a dedicated handheld gaming console. At last I'm content to finally have a true Vita replacement."
39,algunos rayones tiene la consola,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pensaba estaba en mejor estado
40,Good gaming system,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Nintendo switch lite in this blue color works amazing. I prefer this to the actual switch.  It plays and hooks up as it should. My son uses this to play fortnite daily.
41,LOVE IT!,5.0 out of 5 stars,i’ve been thinking about getting this for the longest! i bought the blue one for my fiancé as a gift and he loves it he will be getting me one next !!!
42,Great condition. Best price. Great game.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Device is in great condition even used! The price was an amazing steal, lower than the rest. Screen is clear all buttons work, I’m definitely gonna have fun with this one! Thanks!"
43,Happy purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,My child loves this game console!
44,Lite is Great for Kids,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a parent of 4 I highly recommend getting each one of your kids a Switch Lite. This and streaming apps goes a long way, trust me!"
45,Amazing!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with it definitely worth it been about 3 months now with it works amazingly
46,"Fast, easy, and just as described thank you",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast easy and just as described thank you
47,Like New! Very impressed.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Received a used switch lite in the box and looked and worked brand new! Was finally talked into switching from my New 3DS XL to the Switch (not happy but that’s where all the new games are). Figured I’d start used with the Lite…I’m very impressed. It looked like I ordered it new, and I appreciate that above all. Exactly what was described and exactly what was delivered! You’d expect some kind of flaws, but I’ve found none at all. Five stars!"
48,Birthday gift,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Birthday gift for 8 year old granddaughter. Kids get bored easily. After one month, she barely plays with it."
49,Hotspot disconnection,4.0 out of 5 stars,"bought this a month ago when it was sold by the nintendo company, $199 plus shipping and tax with ended with $123. Came packaged securely and with a charger and the switch in a plastic bag.The battery lasts about four hours for me but three hours when it’s 15%. Bought games for it and the game play is really good graphics and nice feel to it. The joycons have a grip to it and nice the buttons are soft also. Played animal crossing with my friends who also have switch lites and easy connection to the internet. But if you want to play online with local or friends you have to have internet connection! With wifi, it connects just fine and smoothly but with hotspot to a phone or device, it disconnects easily and really angers me. I’ve played many games on it Mario odyssey, Luigis mansion 3, Animal crossing new horizons, and many more and all are good quality. I sometimes give to my little brother and he dropped it a couple times but the screen didn’t crack (Since it’s plastic) and the side buttons click fine. I don’t think it necessary to get a case and screen protector for the switch but your choice is fine. If you already have a the original or newer version of the switch I recommend you shouldn’t get this switch bc it has less features. if you don’t have a switch, this is a really good alternative to the original switch and cheaper regarding the sellers that buy the switches and sell for more. Personally I recommend this switch to new users in the nintendo community! I play this god sent thing everyday nonstop and sometimes I have to force myself to stop! I don’t recommend to buy rn in this pandemic with the prices up to $399, wait have patience and you’ll love this thing!"
50,Happy kid!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very fast delivery. I'm pleased with my purchase. Thank you.
51,Works great!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had my switch for about a month now and I love it! The only issues are that the battery lasts about an hour off the charger and the little joystick on the left makes a weird clicking noise whenever you push it to the left. Otherwise, it’s been awesome!"
52,Love nintendo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nintendo is a great product but I never received it.
53,Nintendo Swithlite,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this for my eldest daughter for her birthday and she hardly puts it down,lol.  If she sits,she has the game in her hands!  I think she loves it,lol"
54,Mostly impressed,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Here we have the Switch Lite, for those who are ready to ditch the TV and make your Switch entirely a portable device.Let's talk about that for a moment. This is an entirely portable device, just a tiny bit larger than a Vita (for the seven of you who have one of those), and with a screen about the size of the average smart phone. The form factor is definitely smaller than that of the regular Switch, and it's much lighter. It's really very comfortable to use.The JoyCons are no more. They still exist, in the sense that you can have external ones attached to this baby, but the system has a pair built in. Now with external ones, you could probably play some two player games together, but honestly I don't much see the point.The screen quality is excellent. Breath of the Wild and Smash look amazing. The games play well, too. It takes a hot second to get used to the controls, but once you're there, you're golden. The sound quality is also very good.The one complaint that I have about the system is the same complaint we've all had about Nintendo in general for years: the online component. I have two X Box 1 S systems (don't ask why), and with those, my game saves, and downloaded games are easily available on both systems. I don't even have to really put any effort into it.With the Switch and Switch Lite, it's different. You have to go through several annoying steps in order to make it happen, and even then, you have to set up one as your primary system and the other as the secondary (I haven't been able to figure out how to do this yet).That complaint aside, and it isn't a small complaint, I'm quite pleased. It's another worthy handheld for Nintendo!"
55,Great product but there’s a problem,4.0 out of 5 stars,The only problem that I have with Nintendo and Nintendo products is that the games are very pricey but this shouldn’t be taken from the actual product
56,This is a great product,5.0 out of 5 stars,This game console is perfect for on the go or road trips.
57,The best handheld console ever made,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Switch Lite is the perfect handheld system, and the best handheld ever made. While not as versatile as its original big brother, it is weighted perfectly and is far more ergonomic than the larger Switch, causing less fatigue over long gaming sessions. For on the go, you simply can't beat it. Best game selection spanning decades, there are games for everyone, and you can play them anywhere and never miss a beat. I have an original Switch as my couch console, and the Lite for on the go. When I am done playing on the TV, the Lite in my backpack automatically starts syncing the last saves and I am ready to go seamlessly. The Lite is just so great as a gaming companion everywhere, finally something to replace the 3DS properly!"
58,Nice,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is so mini and cute but also great for gaming on the go.
59,So far so good.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For starters, a little history.. I brought a REFURBISHED XBOX One X from amazon a YEAR ago, and upon arrival, it looked absolutely brand new.. A YEAR later, it still performs flawlessly..  Now to my switch lite that ive had for a solid month thus far. I dont inderstand some complaints about some who request a new switch but receive a used one.. That really doesnt make any sense.  You order used, and you get used.  You order new and you get new.  I have been playing my switch lite EVERY day on my lunch break, at home after and sometimes il play a few games before i hit the sack. Ive even let my coworkers pass it around at my job so they get to play and now they they all want one.. Not ONE issue with my switch lite thus far even after all the use its been through this month, knock on wood... Just take care of you things.. Dont toss it around in your backpack, dont put it in your pocket without a case, wash your hands before you play it, and dont put uneccesary pressure on your joycons..  Dont dwell on the negative reviews. The $200 bucks ive spent is worth it in spaids. Just my 2 cents worth! And thanks again amazon!"
60,Not a good idea if you're buying for Young ages,3.0 out of 5 stars,This little device is spendy and so are all the games I was expecting a better more durable experience. I didn't even own this 2 months before I know I needed to sell before it would loose its value. It started developing a stick drift in both joy sticks. I simply fixed it the first few times by recalibrating but the time after it wouldn't correct even by recalibrating and finally I messed with the buttons until it finally quit drifting. But I could only imagine if I couldn't get it to stop and having to go pay for repair would make this device not really worth the cost. Yes I did buy this intentionally for my toddlers but I don't think it's meant for toddlers because of how easy it will break.I also had a problem with the charger that it came with not charging and having to troubleshoot that problem also. I hope they can fix this problem if it is an issue on all devices I would reconsider buying another one but just for myself next time not my kids lol
61,My grandson loves it,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nothing
62,I like Nintendo and found this handheld to suit my purposes,5.0 out of 5 stars,I prefer leaving my other console docked and this one mobile. It works for this function and is easy to use.
63,I think I’m the luckiest person ever!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Omg, you don’t know but I’ve been looking around for the switch lite in coral color for a whole week. This damn color was so hard to find, and still is at the moment. I really don’t know how it happened, but I think God had answered my prayers because one late night I was checking amazon again before going to sleep, and omg I thought my eyes deceived me but there it was $199.99 price showing up for the coral lite. I was dumbfounded for a second and then I immediately rushed to click the buy now button. I thought I was just seeing things because when I went back to the page again a few seconds later, it showed the overpriced of $280 -300 instead. I really don’t know how but somehow I was very lucky to grab this coral switch for the retail price. Really, I had to refresh my order page a couple of times to make sure I wasn’t dreaming. I still didn’t want to believe it even after amazon notified me that the item will ship soon. Anyways long story short, I refused to believe it until I finally got this lovely switch yesterday. The switch looked lovely as ever, and I cannot wait to play games with my sister soon. Well what can I say? Miracles ( or luck) do happen, people. I hope everyone who wanted to get a switch/lite will get theirs soon without having to pay the overpriced tag, just like me."
64,Great purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my new nintendo switch light blue. I love the type of blue it is, it's my favorite color. It plays well, I put in a 1TB memory card and plays and downloads games with no problem. The memory card I got it through Amazon for better price than a nintendo one."
65,Problems,3.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve had problems from the start now it’s charging problems can’t use the same charger twice
66,Beautiful Color,5.0 out of 5 stars,My nephew loves everything about this Nintendo Switch Lite! The best part I told the shipper it was for his birthday and they rushed so we could be sure he received it in time.
67,An Amazing handheld with some Serious FLAWS,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a guy in my mid 30's, I live in Southern California, and I'm a huge Nintendo fan. I just got the Nintendo Switch Lite and have been playing it for the last few days. This system has a LOT going for it, but it falls short of being great.First, let's start with the PROS:1. It's a smaller, more portable switch2. It has a regular/traditional Dpad, better for 2d games3. It's semi-pocketable, making it easier to take with you on the go4. It's pretty lightweight5. It has a crisp, high resolution screen6. There's some pretty decent games on the Switch: Mario Maker 2, Mario Odyseey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Zelda, and now SNES games online7. This is the first true Nintendo portable system in about 15 years that goes back to having a SINGLE screen. I like that because I thought the second screen on the DS/3DS/2DS line were just gimmicks that you didn't really need8. It's a portable that has console quality graphics on the go9. It's the first true portable from Nintendo that has an ANALOG STICK! Before, it was only a slider, now its a true stick.10. It's a sleek, modern looking unit.Okay, now the CONS...1. It's not that cheap. $199 doesn't include the cost of the game, sales tax, shipping, a case, etc.2. This is the first ""portable"" system in which the games are the cost of a home console. $60/each.3. There's no rumble feature4. There's no TV out5. It's a switch with no ""switching"" feature6. The Analog stick is not nearly as good as the analog joystick on the N64. The N64 had a wider degree of freedom/precision.7. The DPad is TINY! I mean, REALLY tiny, so much so that its difficult to use8. The DPad is MISALIGNED (not horizontally aligned) with the action buttons9. There's no STYLUS! It's only compatible with those so-called ""styluses"" that have dull, rubber nibs.10. On the right side of the unit, the right analog stick pokes up at your thumb when pressing the ""B"" button11. It's nothing TRULY innovative. It's a smaller switch. That's it. Would have been nice if Nintendo made something really ahead of its time, like a flexible display (see Samsung Galaxy Fold)12. No N64 games! Where's the N64 virtual console? This system would be great for that.13. It's still NOT comfortable in the pocket. Would have been better if it could fold up, so it was easier to take with you everywhere14. It's not that ""lite."" The unit has a considerable weight to itSo, I have mixed feelings about the switch lite. It's a step forward in the right direction, but I felt Nintendo could have been more careful in its design, and more daring in its innovation/delivery."
68,Working beautifully,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased mine from a 3rd party seller, Geek Alliance, for a little bit over retail (only like $20, so not scalper crazy) because it was the only choice as it was a last minute addition to the Christmas list and No One had the Coral in stock. I paid for expedited and it came earlier than expected. It was the Japanese edition but runs no differently. All signs point to brand new and we haven't had any issues with it what so ever. It was for our 7 y/o that's on the spectrum, so for her to branch out so seamlessly from her Kindle is a huge step and Geek Alliance helped us make that possible."
69,Grate,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is so fun to play with I get addicted.
70,Love how much less it weighs compared to regular switch,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it ❤️
71,Cute little guy with big attitude,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this switch lite so I could take it with me when I move out so I wouldn’t have to take our family switch. It is soooo great! I bought it used-very good and honestly it almost seems brand new. I was super worried it would come damaged or with scratches or that it would get lost. But nope! Got delivered to my doorstep not a scratch, and even needed a signature too which made me feel so much better!! Anywho about the actual switch. I was also worried that the screen would be too small and I wouldn’t enjoy playing breath of the wild or Skyrim on it (soon the new animal crossing game as well) but while playing, it seems as tho I’m playing handheld on the regular switch (playing docked and on a tv gives me a headache anyway so I prefer this) the only thing I worry about now is the drift issue which happens on the switch where the control sticks start to drift. Luckily I know how to fix that myself (you can watch YouTube videos on how to do it) but unfortunately, instead of just taking apart the joy cons I’m gonna have to take the whole thing apart and get under the motherboard 😅😅😅 so. That hasn’t happened yet but I definitely encourage  Nintendo to do something about that since the lite can’t replace joycons for those who don’t know how to fix them."
72,What I imagined,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought the switch lite for myself, saw some of the reviews and was worried about my purchase, but luckily everything for the console works, and even the downloaded games work without wifi, will probably buy a normal switch later on down the line but this will suffice for now"
73,So much fun,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had the original nintendo switch when it first came out and i loved it. it was a bit heavy for me to play hand held though. and it broke :’) . so i decided to buy the lite to see how well i’d like it. and i LOVE it. I got it specifically for the pokémon arceus game and it’s amazing. the switch lite battery lasts for a good 3 hours with non stop play. and it’s “lite” duh dun chhhh. overall i’m very glad i got this switch it’s amazing.
74,Portable Goodness,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It arrived safe and sound from the seller. I absolutely love it! I've been wanting to buy a Switch for a long time but debated on which one, the regular or LITE. I ended up opting for the Lite version.  The screen is slightly smaller than a regular switch but it's not that big of a deal as I've played on other smaller screens before such as the 3DS and PSP-- which are tinier in comparison and also had smaller analog sticks and buttons.Additionally, I decided to get my hands on separate joycons and a phone stand for the switch Lite which allows me to sit back on a chair and enjoy at a distance when I dont want to hold it. Overall, I'm glad to have made the purchase. Now I can finally play LOZ: BOTW at my own comfort and glee.Please note that if you plan to share the LITE in a family, it wouldn't be ideal as there is no docking option. This is ideal for  individuals who loves to travel around their own home or around other places. Sharing accounts isn't very ideal on this either,  so consider investing on a regular Switch instead or buy a physical  copy of the game if you wish to share."
75,Awesome!,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves this!
76,Great,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
77,Good Quality and good stuff,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No problems with it at all so far, and spent a TON of time playing it, so if your on a crunch, I would 100% recommend it."
78,Gifts for Grandson’s,5.0 out of 5 stars,They Love this hand held game
79,Came one month earlier then it was supposed to,4.0 out of 5 stars,It came super early which is nice but we were out of town for christmas and only bought it because it was estimated to arrive well after we got back. Works great it seems though. No issues with it that are related to the shipping or seller. Just general complaints about how Nintendo designed it honestly.
80,"Fun, but not $200 fun.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to play animal crossing with my girlfriend and maybe a few other titles for myself if it worked out that way. After a few months with this device my conclusions are this:Animal crossing was fun. There are plenty of games for this machine, but it is underpowered compared to a regular switch. Demos I have downloaded such as resident evil have had frame rates that look to be 15 or 20, stuttery and just bad. The Nintendo Online service, which I needed to play the game with my girlfriend and browse their online store, costs you a monthly fee and seems to have literally no curation or thought put into it, while also having the most expensive prices I have seen and the worst sales. Id love to try out more titles but next to nothing good ever goes on sale, and from what I have researched this is normal Nintendo. The Zelda game is supposed to be good, but it is still $60 and never goes on sale yet it’s almost 4 years old.  Come on. This is a fun system, just beware of its limitations and costs."
81,Got it for kid,5.0 out of 5 stars,She loves it and uses it all the time. Shipped fast!
82,As expected despite negative reviews,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It came in a perfectly packaged box, with the charger in perfect condition, no scratches or defects, I was able to login to my old account and re-download EVERYTHING, the only complaint I have is that it took a week to deliver but considering these are in high demand, it's not that big of a deal."
83,Very fun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very light.
84,Great gaming device,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great gaming device for the value
85,Birthday Present,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have not given yet, but he certainly wants it!"
86,The Nintendo Switch is region Free,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They don't really advertise this fact, but it is true. I confirmed this in two ways.1. Bought some international software to play on this US Switch Lite. It worked perfecta as it should have.2. I also communicated with Nintendo customer service. This was before I purchased the international software. They confirmed that indeed these consoles are not coded by region, in essence making them region free. They did give me a disclaimer that maybe not all international's features are guaranteed to work on every console. We haven't had any issues at all, everything works perfectly.+ Its region free. Region coding a offing stupid and super annoying. Im glad they did away with it on this console.+ Its portable+ Great price for a portable game console.+ Nintendo customer service is awesome! You can even contact them via chat.- Do not try top transfer a user profile from one switch to another. It was super confusing and I ended up losing all my saved data. Yes that did piss me off. I am knocking a full star off for that.The Nintendo Switch is my current favorite gaming console. LUVLUVLUV it."
87,Portable and Perfect Size,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first tried using the original Switch I felt that it was too large in the hands and had a considerable weight to it which took away a lot from the handheld experience. I’m happy to say that the Switch Lite fixes all of these issues thanks to its lighter and smaller overall footprint. It’s a delight to play with and the battery life seems to be about as good as advertised. I’m getting an estimated 3.5-4 hours with Link’s Awakening which is a fairly demanding game. The screen is also extremely bright and looks absolutely beautiful. The colors are also a lot more muted than I had previously thought they would be. The Gray and the Turquoise both look very nice, though I like my gray one the most because of the nice contrast with the buttons. Speaking of the buttons, they feel extremely good. The buttons are more “mushy” than the regular switch but feel very satisfying. The inclusion of the d-pad is also a welcome addition and it feels just amazing. It’s definitely the best d-pad I’ve ever used. The d-pad has the just the right amount of tactile click and mushiness making it a dream to use. If you can forgive the lack of TV output, this is the best handheld gaming console there is and in my opinion the best Switch there is currently."
88,Not bad at all,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad, although certain games don't work well with a little switch lite screen because it's so small. I struggle with Skyrim and Minecraft. Be aware also that sandbox games run about a the most. Be warned, sandbox games and large RPGs work about as well on this as they do on PS3, which means buggy quests and weird graphics errors. But I'm cheap, and this device makes me happy."
89,Love this little thing !,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Me and my husband purchased this gadget because we both love Nintendo and we don’t have a lot time to play on TV games so this handheld is deff worth the money ! It had a lot of games and can hold about 3 games without an sd card so I’d suggest getting one but NOT THE 500 something gig cause it’ll corrupt your files but other than that I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!"
90,Grandbaby likes it,5.0 out of 5 stars,Birthday gift
91,great Hand held for travelling,5.0 out of 5 stars,"so I travel a lot and don't spend a lot of time at home. I also play a lot of single player games. So when this system was announced I though great, something I can carry that I don't have to worry about the Joy cons coming off or really needing a big case that my not fit well in to the bag I am carrying. So I picked this up it has been great I carry it everywhere. it plays all the games I have. I still have a OG Switch at home that i use for playing the games that require a constant online connection to play. but I really like having the Switch lite as something to carry around that takes up a small amount of space.Pros:Small form factorno joycons to come loose or break if not in a casebattery lasts longer than the OG Switchsolid build qualitylower priceCons:can't connect to a TVif wanting to play with others you need to get a set of JoyconsOverall it is a great system at a good price point for those the want a Switch but think $300 is to much."
92,great condition,4.0 out of 5 stars,the product was like new no cosmetic defects
93,Only 1 complaint.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very fun games. I bought the light to save some money and ny nephew has the original already. My only single 1 complaint is the battery. No one ever warned me about how bad the battery is. And this is supposed to last longer than the original battery? It's fine for a bus trip but definitely not a road trip out of town it lasts maybe 4ish hours. It's not horrible but I remember how the DS, DS lite, 3DS lasted me so long and I could leave it on sleep for months and they would be close to fullIt feels great in my hands. Ashamed to say I have smallish hands for a man. about medium+ glove size. Buttons feel a lot better than the joy cons do. Small enough to fit in male pant pockets unless you wear skinny jeans maybe, I wear lose pants.The speakers a fairly loud or loud enough for me at half volume in a noisy house.Update year later. It turns out my hands aren't as small as I thought. My sister just has huge man hands like kawhi Leonard so I thought I had small hands. I'm a large size - XLarge size glove."
94,Awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my nintendo switch lite. I'm a bit of a gaming nerd. It came on time, no damage, brand new out of the box. And it almost had a full charge too. So I was able to set it up and download a couple games before charging it. This is also great for my son for when we're on trips because it had a parental lock on it."
95,I LOVE THIS THING💗,5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is my first nintendo product ever and i’m so pleased! i always wanted to play animal crossing new horizons & now i can! i’ve had this for about 3ish months. i’ve never experienced any shifting with the joysticks or anything like that, there’s really no flaws in my opinion and from what i can see😁👍ALSO. the charger is super long which comes in handy when the outlet is sooo far😂"
96,Portable and Decent battery/Graphics,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The device is surprisingly light, for the battery capacity and quality of gameplay. It’s an excellent console for smaller games I play online or with friends. Usually I have to clean my hands to preserve the white joysticks, since they get a bit stained after long-term use. Although, everything else is good. The joysticks are still good with no drift, and the motion sensors for some games are pretty smooth (Overwatch is a good example). But, one of the joysticks has a metal spring sound whenever i accidentally flick it. Not sure if it’s a problem but it doesn’t affect gameplay for me."
97,"One step above the 3DS XL, but not much.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Nintendo Switch Lite offers handheld only play. Which is fine. The color of the Lite is cosmetic only with many different case and skin options. I was able to play a game on the Lite as I play on my console and the first thing I noticed was graphic issues. Distant artifacts (moving objects, other players, static objects) tend to be more pixelated. The farther away they were the more pixelated they were. Some I couldn’t even recognize, even though I’m extremely familiar with the game. A simple 15 minute game play reduced the battery from 100% to 83% with the game mentioned earlier. Battery life varies from game to game. The device got warm while playing but was noticeably warmer while charging, in sleep mode. Thankfully there is a setting to power the device completely off to save battery instead of keeping it in sleep mode. The device felt sluggish trying to play said game. Not sure if the game was taxing the system as there is a lot going on and needs to be connected to WiFi. Has many Nintendo classic games for sale of course, or you can buy new games for $60. Which the price of them doesn’t fall for almost a year. The screen is a touchscreen. Overall I would give the Nintendo Switch Lite a generous 4/5 stars. But I’m reality it’s a 3/5 star device due to no backward compatibility with prior system games, high cost of games long after they’ve came out, very limited free games section, weak battery life and as I said before a weak graphics chip. The Lite should have cost $150, with the regular switch costing $250. If you see the Lite being sold for more than $199 then your being scammed. Buy from someone else or someplace else. The regular Switch is being sold for $299. Again higher prices means your being scammed. Regardless of the color of the device or controllers."
98,Didnt work,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my grandson when he got it it did not work.  It has nothing to do with the seller as anything human made can do that.
99,AMAZING PRODUCT,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works great and hasn’t had any issues so far with working it or setting up!! Amazing products😁
100,Great Console for all ages!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought the Nintendo Switch Lite for my Brother this past week and my Sister a couple months back and they both love it! My brother is especially loving it and it makes me so happy to see him loving it so much! I’d say the only complaint I have but isn’t that big of a deal is the setback of only having it portable but that’s just my own opinion and does not discourage my sister or brother in any way. It’s a great product and I’d highly recommend it to anybody who’s looking into buying a cheaper version of the Switch “Also lookout for Joycon Drift especially on the Lite since it can be a real pain for both the regular switch and Lite”
101,Great for on the go gaming and very pocket friendly!,5.0 out of 5 stars,This system is great if you’re on the go a lot and don’t really need to play on the TV.  Whatever version of the Switch you choose you’re still going to get access to a stellar line up of games old and new!
102,Awesome ❤️,5.0 out of 5 stars,Came in ahead of time. Beautiful condition for referbished. Works fantastic.
103,"It's not as great as the original switch, but if you need an alternative, this can work.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the lite because the price of the regular switch console just kept going up. The switch lite arrived within a decent amount of time. I've probably had it for two months now and I like the feel of lite, but I really do wish it had an adapter or something to connect to the tv because the smaller screen just doesn't bring home the intensity for some games. The lite works just fine and all the parts were in it. As you can see in my, I've modified my lite. The thumb grips seemed like a must for the lite, as without them my thumbs kept slipping off the analog sticks and I kept accidentally pressing in on the analog stick on some games trying to make keep my thumbs from slipping when i needed to attempt soft maneuvers. Battery lasts about 2.5 hours, so i don't have to worry too much about charging when I'm on the go."
104,Fits me perfectly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I love my switch. I am slowly coming back into gaming and I needed an in between console until I get my ps5. This was perfect for my needs. The only down side I can see is that not that many people I know have a switch so I can’t play multiplayer and they don’t have be repertoire of games. However, if your into specific games like Mario, crash, or big names like that then this is a great console to have.They also have a lot of indie games if that’s what you are into."
105,Best handheld console in recent times,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As this is my first switch I’ve owned, I cannot compare it to the original one, but as a standalone product I can-it feels really nice to hold, there’s no getting used to how it’s designed, and my hands don’t get stiff if I play too long-it works really well as a portable console, the ability to play certain games like doom, or skyrim anywhere is really fun, it brings me back to when I had a 3ds-quality games, Nintendo never fails at making a fun product, Mario, animal crossing, etc, the games alone make this worth buying-games are kind of overpriced, Minecraft is 30$, terraria is 30$, doom 2016 is 60$, etc etc, just keep in mind switch games ARE NOT cheap"
106,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works and feels great! Love it!! Got to me overnight!
107,Looks promising but so disappointed. Just don't buy it,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My family controls my life so strictly as I was a junior student at school. My old dream were to own a PSP console. Years later, now I can afford any machine as long as I want it. However, this purchase made me really angry. As the great Gatsby movie quote. You cannot repeat the past. It did not give me that warmth I ever wanted to have. Four points to bet you give it up.1. Poor quality display. I was prepared but never expected such a horrible one. You cannot get used to it anymore as long as you used any $500 phone before.2. Horrible sound quality, no any special sound processing .3. You must quit your game center hooked up with your TV before you can have anything playable on your lite as a backup machine. I know its copyright problem but it is just extremely disgusting in this platform. Why did I bother to even try one as I have iPad mini6, iPad pro11 and iPad pro 12.9 plus couple of other high end phones. Indeed, they may not have that many first hand games officially but we can try PPSSPP simulator on phone or iPad. Then you can just enjoy yourself without worrying about any syncing problems. Lol4. Wow, what a cheaply made grip.Indeed, I requested too much from a $200 device as cheap as cheap always. I will back to my iPad and maybe Sony PlayStation thereafter. And leave one OLED edition hooked it up with the TV for my guests in weekend party. But just not for me, fortunately, I only purchased one 512GB SD Card for this gadget and I will not waste too much on it.In a word, if you were not familiar with nitendo gaming system or looking to find your old dreams and trying to repeat them. Never ever try this machine. Looks like an awesome item but horrible experience and only brings you anger and you may just crack it in a near future.Above"
108,Quality Switch!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price!None were available in Hawaii during Xmas. Amazon rose to the occasionProduct came early & in good packaging!No scratches & works prefectly!
109,I mean it works,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It was listed as Used-Good and probably would barely qualify as Used -Acceptable. The port for the charger is cracked in two places, there’s two noticeable deep scratches in the screen and the trigger buttons on top are crusty like something sticky was spilled on this and never cleaned off. It was only $30 cheaper than retail and I got a quality of product that would be on Facebook market place. So frustrating! I should’ve just bought it full price from Nintendo."
110,Needs and update,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There is nothing wrong with Nintendo Switch, it's an awesome system full of awesome games. However, Nintendo is charging $200.00 for 2015 tech, some games stutter and are unable to run at 60 fps."
111,Great,5.0 out of 5 stars,Size and color
112,Perfect Gift for a nine year old,4.0 out of 5 stars,I gifted this to my 9 year old great nephew he absolutely love it.  Nintendoneeds to consider adding at least one game cartridge.
113,Great game system!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This game system is fantastic. I have been using it to play a number of games, and the buttons, screen quality, and overall weight of the system are perfect. The bright yellow color is wonderful as well! :) -- The only recommendation I would make is to get a case for your switch to protect it for storage and travel, especially to protect the screen.Although people have been talking about button drift (and I have read plenty of negative reviews about it), I have not personally experienced this issue with my Switch."
114,Absolutely Love It,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a beautiful birthday present for my son and he fell in love with it. The quality was great. The color was beautiful. Setting it up was fast and efficient and it has a descent amount of memory space. The shipping was super fast as well.
115,Fun!,4.0 out of 5 stars,I Purchased the original switch for my grandchildren to play when they came to my houseThey like to play it enough that I decided to buy Nintendo switch light for them for Christmas at their houseI had emailed Nintendo asking them before I bought it if I could transfer the data that I had purchased on the original switch to the switch light and never got a reply so I was a little concerned about buying itOnce I received the Nintendo switch light I went into set up which was really easy to do and it allowed me to download the purchases I had made on the original switchSo now they can play all the games on the switch light that we have on the original switch which is amazing and save me hundreds of dollars on games.
116,Ok,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's okay it's just a battery goes dead too fast I like it if I could afford the games for it I just got one game but I guess obviously get some games work I like the animal crossing the new one that I got
117,Defective Switch but Great Customer Service,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the switch and when playing there was a loud noise. The noise was coming from the fan. The noise was so loud that I couldn’t hear the game at all.The reason that I gave a five star for this item, is for the transaction itself. Amazon was great! When I contacted them and explained the situation they immediately gave me instructions on how to return the item and I received the refund immediately. Unfortunately, I couldn’t reorder the Switch from the seller because it was sold out at that time."
118,The only place that didn't gauge prices,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's used but works like brand new. They included the game and the charger, which was all I needed.Every other place right now is gauging prices like crazy. A Switch Lite should only cost $199, but everywhere that still has them is charging between $260-$320 at the moment.I got lucky enough to find this place selling a used SL for $169 and it was worth every penny.The game system is light and easy to handle while still feeling sturdy. The screen shows off a super clear picture and so many details that it blows my mind to realize we've come this far with hand-held systems.The controls respond very quickly, and I'm incredibly happy with my purchase."
119,Arrived on time and in good condition.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything was as expected and my Switch is working great.
120,Nintendo makes good products,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nintendo always does a good job and the switch lite is no exception. It's untrue that you can't play games unless connected to the internet. I played Animal Crossing and several other games for weeks to months without being connected to the internet (digital downloads and hard copies). Whoever wrote that must be talking about specific content in a specific game that requires internet (many games have features that require internet, that's not new).System is very light weight, has a good battery life and sits very comfortably in your hands. Colors are bright and it charges very quickly. Totally worth getting, I've spent hours upon hours happily playing games on it."
121,Getting me through 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this to help me get through 2020. Best decision ever. Playing all of the Dragon Quest games the switch has available including the DQ11. I did read that many people have problems with the drifting of the controllers and was worried about that, but after months of heavy use I still don’t have any problems. I’ve played well over hundreds of hours so I got my money’s worth. I know it’s hard to get across a switch these days or even a switch lite, but keep an eye out and it’s totally worth paying the original price."
122,Items you need for your Switch Lite and color matches perfect!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have to say this is a quality kit and I am using most of what came with it.  Case is top notch the glass screen protectier is perfect and the back plate cover makes the switch much easier to hold.  Can not go wrong for the price!  I will say if you own a yellow switch Lite like I do put some paper towel inside the case where the back plate grips lay inside as mine did get some black staining.  I wrote to the company and hopefully they correct this. Must have kit if you buy a Switch Lite!
123,"Good product,a touch pricey unless you have money to burn",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable and fun to use,full color.Pretty sturdy.I should know,Ive dropped it a couple times.I’m happy with it overall for sure"
124,Christmas gift for 6 year old,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this for my 6 year old because she has been dying to play games with her dad. She picked up how to use it quick.
125,Recreational Gaming for Beginners!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super fun, highly recommend if you are not a video game person but for some reason you feel left out, after almost a year after the pandemic started and after watching endless hours of reviews, unboxing, and customization youtube videos and you say ""enough is enough"" and you buy it in the middle of the night so you won't remember and immediately forgive yourself after playing for around 10 mins. So yeah, if you can get it please treat yourself!"
126,4/5,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect! Came with everything together and not broken. But the “ coral” shown looks nothing like the real collar but it is fine! Came with free a game to Download. I was very happy. The game was fortnite. Very happy with this purchase!
127,Doesnt connect to a tv,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The system feels like matte paint it doesnt or feels glossy. I like it this way, less finger prints etc.. but it can get dirty and stained quicker. Can not be atached to tv like the previous one. That i dont like as much but if u have both like i do. I just use this one as a back up. At first i thought u couldnt do multiplayer cuz, you cant remove the joy cons. But if you own or buy another set, it can still be detected.in other word you can still play mario party , kart etc 2,3 or 4 players..the downside again  no tv. But so far the console responds and its still the same switch."
128,"Opened the Nintendo Switch box, but No Nintendo Switch only the charging cord…",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my order on time as ordered the box was in good condition. I wrapped the box and gave it to my grandson for his 8th birthday, only for him to open the box with no Nintendo Switch only item in the box was the charging cord."
129,Fantastic!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've thoroughly enjoyed this smaller, lighter, handheld version of the Nintendo Switch. It's the perfect size for a device that you can throw in your bag, but at the same time, has the power to play expansive games that you can get lost in.Honestly, I don't find myself missing the ability to play on my TV or use the detachable Joycons. I know it may sound crazy, but I would gladly trade my Nintendo Switch for my Nintendo Switch Lite, and with the price tag of the former at $100 more, for me, that makes total sense.P.S. If you want to play the SNES games through your Nintendo Switch Online Subscription, this D-Pad is flipping awesome. I can't stop playing Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past!"
130,Love the variety of games and the option to play with family and friends!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is awesome!! So much fun, and I love being able to play with my family and friends. I also love that I can access and play so many of the older games I grew up playing - from the original NES, Super Nintendo, and so on - while also being able to play the newer games. I’m so excited to finally have one of these!"
131,It was a great value.,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves it. The only thing I don't like is the fact that you have to pass off the device to a friend to play with you. I should have spent the extra money and gotten the regular version that way it could hook up to the tv and a friend can play at the same time. But overall great product and delivered quickly.
132,This is awesome👍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If your looking to get a cheaper yet effective portable device, then this product is right for you. Just make sure to buy a coverage plan along with other stuff such as screen protector and a case for it if your kids want one. Price was very good and more than fair and I haven't had any issues since."
133,Excellent,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can you say??It's a great system.But I've been buying or playing Nintendo's stuff since the mid 80's so maybe I am a biased fanboy?Nah, it's a great system either way. Worth $300 for the larger system and $200 for a lite is almost stealing imo"
134,Coral Lite,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really didnt want to buy a lite because I wanted to buy the regular switch. However, after the high demand for the switches and high prices I decided to go for a switch. The color is absolutely beautiful! I think its the best color out of all the switches! The lite is light and easy to carry. I use it to play animal crossing and I love it! If you don’t want to spend as much money on a regular switch make sure you buy a lite! Definitely worth its money value!"
135,Juegos para llevar,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Una gran consola ahora en su versión mini, o Lite como la llamó Nintendo. Lo primero que debes saber es que esta consola es solo portátil, es más pequeña, mas liviana y sin la posibilidad de conectar a una TV, está pensada para sostenerse en la palma de la mano, los joycon no son desacoplables. Dicho esto es un apuesta sólida con un catálogo de juegos amplio, robusto y para todos los gustos, eso si fíjate que salvando las diferencias, hay juegos que no dan la misma experiencia que la Switch normal."
136,Perfect,5.0 out of 5 stars,And it even showed up early.
137,My son is very happy!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very well protect it by the package, very nice, original, easy to set up...very glad of my purchase!!"
138,Great purchase!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with our purchase. Well packaged and fast shipping.
139,Easy gaming and just fun,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have played the original Switch, but I love the Lite so much better! Of course the price tag is better for my wallet, but also the games are 100% the same and I would argue look a little bit better on the smaller screen with the same resolution.The only downside is you can't cast to a television, but I wasn't looking for that feature. If you are, stay with the original. If not, this is a perfect console for sitting around the house and playing games that are more complicated and engaging than mobile phone games on iphone or android."
140,I love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works perfectly!! I'm really enjoying animal crossing and I'm even thinking about decorating it. There are better reviews from people who game on the regular but..It doesn't have a cheap plastic feel to me and feels sturdy. it's hard plastic and the screen is also a hard plastic and smudge proof. I could drop it many times and it'd be fine, especially since it's pretty light."
141,Best choice for spending less.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I loved the Nintendo Switch lite and the handheld ability to have a better feel for playing games. But it didnt come with a kickstand or a dock so I had to pay for the dock separately. So far the Switch Lite is my favorite if you dont want to pay extra for the actual Switch itself.
142,Good,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it
143,A great console,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! It’s very portable and easy to use. It’s a great handheld console for kids that will keep them busy while you are getting trashed at the bar ignoring your parenting skills
144,Great Buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Light version of the switch because I didn't want to buy another console.The switch Light screen is smaller than the Switch itself but it is Light weight and easy to play.Set up was very easy and straightforward too. I highly recommend this system. It's great as a hand held device and convenient for travel, especially with kids."
145,Portable light weight easy to use.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it!!! Easy to use and durable. I love the fact that you can easily take this on the go. Doesn’t connect to the tv like the Nintendo switch original version. You can play with friends vía wifi or local. You do have to pay for an online membership if you are wanting to play with friends via internet. Graphics are amazing on this and charging is fast. The battery will last you a long time.
146,I love my Switch Lite!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my Nintendo Switch Lite. I’m simple; I grew up on Super Mario and the Wii. This newest update for single handheld gaming is great for someone who just wants to play games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons by herself. I don’t need the docking station Switch, and I love having my own gameboy to enjoy. Great for travel, relaxing time, any time I want to play. Also love the coral pink color! :) Worth the money for me. I really enjoy it."
147,My favorite gaming console,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this switch so so so so so much! I love the color! I talk a lot about this switch to my friends. This was my graduation gift and I've been playing on this since May and I've never stopped lolol. The joy of gaming :)
148,Nintendo switch,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought it as a gift for my wife. She totally loves it.
149,Came as described,5.0 out of 5 stars,Item came as described and by delivery date.
150,Well worth the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got yellow because it's different from what I usually get. I love my switch lite. It's worked perfectly since I got it, and I play play it pretty frequently. It's pretty comfortable to hold and use too. I used to have a pop and I like playing on this more."
151,Good buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,My two sons play with this all the time. It’s quite durable and holds charge for the day.
152,Arrived on time and as expected,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift. Arrived on time and as expected
153,Arrived on time,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived on time, it works perfect, condition is new."
154,"First one died within a few uses, 2nd one works great",4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Switch Lite died within a week of getting (3 total uses). By die I mean that the console wouldn't turn on at all, despite having a full charge at the time, trying hard reset, etc.  I'm getting a replacement and will update the review when I get it.****""Edit:******I have a new device that has been working really well for several months. I love the device. It's extremely portable and fun to play.  I will say that several games don't work with the lite but if you read reviews before buying you should be fine."
155,No Idea What This Does,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nephew wanted it, he’s happy, then I’m happy."
156,It works good for a pre-owned item!,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall good console. The L button gets stuck but not a big issue!
157,Delivery person was careless,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The product it’s self was fine , and everything worked well. I would give it 5 stars, but the person who delivered the item , literally decided to just throw it in a puddle of water , right when they see me turn on my porch light."
158,Seeing A Smile On My Son Face,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A very nice handheld game I’ve brought for my step son he really loves it. Good to let your child take on road trips or just playing with it at home. Also, it’s very easy to set up an account profile. If I had more kids I’ll buy it for them as well, very worth the money."
159,Love it!  Not one complaint!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So to start off it should be noted that I own the original Switch (which I have loved since the day it came out).  Decided to get this one to use as more portable option to bring with me on trips.  I did notice that it was quite a bit lighter smaller than the original Switch but, despite this, it maintains a solid feel in the hands.  Doesn't feel cheap or flimsy at all.  I purchased the Turquoise version and love the color.  This is really a great system and I am sure to play it for years to come!"
160,Good enough,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Lite doesn't have any way to connect to a TV, but there's no JoyCons to charge. The battery life and screen aren't exactly amazing, but all in all the lower price makes it worth it. My only regret was getting the Gray one instead of waiting for Coral Pink."
161,Great Bday gift,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best birthday gif for my 7 year old boy
162,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was a gift for my fiancé. Easy gaming on the go. He’s able to take it with him to work and keep himself entertained on long slow nights.
163,Package was damaged,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Package was damaged but the switch was fine , I was a little worried at first but thankfully nothing bad happened to the switch ."
164,"Great purchase, button issues within months however",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my Switch, but some commonly used buttons are starting to have response issues after only three to five months of steady use.I bought a transparent case and screen protector for it so I can’t comment on its own physical durability. The Switch Lite is overall a good size, shape, and look. I’ve used (but didn’t have) the regular Switch, but haven’t felt like I’m missing out on anything, since I just wanted a handheld device and not a TV-connected console. I basically feel like I have a lesser DS (no stylus, no flip design, no double screens, not as portable), but with a bigger screen for visuals and a better, newer games library than the DS had.The buttons dilemma hasn’t made it unusable yet and it has been a good source of fun, so for now I still think it was worth the purchase."
165,Great for tween daughter!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought the Switch Lite for my daughter for Xmas 2020 and it was a big hit. She loves her Switch Lite and uses it everyday. I am thrilled that she has gotten so much use from her Switch Lite.
166,Loved it! but if you have kids would recommend the original one,5.0 out of 5 stars,I loved it! Came in good condition and did a good job shipping. But I would like to inform all of the parents considering to buy this for more than 1 kid. I don’t suggest it. Why I think it’s harder to share and you can’t play multiplayer. The only reason I got it is because I don’t share with much people. If you are considering getting one I suggest just get one for each kid.
167,Great Condition!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that it is actually NEW. Came sealed, with all the protection on it and even though it took a little time, it was worth it. I wanted to get this color for my sister's birthday but everywhere I went here, they were all sold out. I'm happy that I was able to find this in Coral (which is the one I was looking for) and it was worth the price. My sister loved it!"
168,"Compact, good when traveling",5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift to grandson…he’s happy
169,Lite vs standard,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s not as good as the standard but it gets the job done
170,Needs frequent cleaning,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice color. I don’t like having to clean under the left toggle with rubbing alcohol, but if I don’t do it my character starts to wander, rather than stay in place. I understand this is a known problem, but it SHOULD be fixed by now. Sloppy management."
171,Replacement for a switch,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ordered to replace an regular switch. The only difference is the lack of rumbling feature. Would highly recommend this over a regular switch as we replaced the paddles at least 4 times.
172,Came in great condition,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was a little worried ordering a Nintendo Switch from the internet bit it arrived on time and in great condition
173,Son loves it. Easier to hold & control w/ smaller hands,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son was always using his fathers switch he got last Christmas. So we got his own. He loves it. Perfect for his little hands. He’s 4 1/2yrs old. Actually teaching me how to play games now. Better for him but wish the sides came off like his fathers switch (reg. Switch that docks).
174,Came in earlier than expected no issues brand new,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Came in early, no issues"
175,"Highest quality, at a discount, plus easy online syncing",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Highest quality (dedicated) Nintendo handheld since the 3DS XL. 2/3 the weight of the big Switch, and the cloud sync feature with Nintendo Switch Online is absolutely lovely (for the most part).The missing features are glaring, but if you have a Switch, (for example, a family Switch that's always in the living room/den,) then a family NSO subscription and a handful of Switch Lites is the *perfect* gift. Just make sure you set up the eShop accounts on the Switch Lites *first*, and then log in on the main unit."
176,Very nice,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grandkids love it
177,Teen Approved,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my 13 year old for Christmas and he barely puts it down.  He specifically asked for a yellow one and says it is ""great"" so I guess it is.  I admit I don't play it but felt a parental point-of-view might be helpful to some.  My wife and I do watch what he plays and he hasn't been playing anything age inappropriate.  Since he likes it, we feel it was worth the purchase as a gift."
178,i'm happy to have this unit in my favorite color,5.0 out of 5 stars,i'm glad that this unit is in my favorite color as soon as i saw this advertised i wanted it immedietly
179,It’s good for what it’s worth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, so it is exactly as what it said it was going to be, not as good as the original switch, I thankfully have family switch, but if you have a family and don’t really want to share, this is what you should get, but I do miss having removable joy-cons"
180,Bee Yellow Nintendo Switch!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You can't see the original Switch Lite because I added a decal, but the game system came in perfect condition.I was originally going to pick turquoise, but I couldn't wait until the restock!The system works fine, it's lightweight before adding the decal & the case, so keep that in mind when deciding to decorate your Switch."
181,Lots of fun,4.0 out of 5 stars,The color is fun. This was a gift for our child. She loves it. We like that there are no removable joy cons for her to lose.great gift It seems durable & most switch games can be played on it as long as it is not a game that requires removable joy cons. It was a little pricey as to supply is low & demand is high.
182,Amazing buy!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it so fun and poetable
183,My favorite hand held councile,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my counsil. Easy to transport, comfortable in my hands, and great graphics. I play alone so this was perfect for me to play anywhere. If you are a single player who wants the freedom to play wherever with a sleek light council I totally recommend."
184,Defective,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our charging port quit working after having it a month and we are in the process of find a place to repair it.
185,Awesomesauce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it! Couldn't find any switches anywhere in a 200 mile radius so we went to Amazon and they have every color. The switch looks and works perfectly. Had to get another because it was so good and came in fast.
186,The seller did a great job replacing the one that I was sent I would buy from them  again,5.0 out of 5 stars,There was nothing that I dislike about it like I said I would buy from them again
187,A good console,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got me Switch , came in new . It was nice and clean . Had no problems with it , works very well . Easy to use , I recommend y’all to buy the lite if y’all don’t want to waste that much money on the original switch."
188,Love,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the switch. It took me so long to get one but fell in love with it. Some old get titled game that I used to play when I was a kid on the go. Plus fantastic new game that are amazing. Also I don't have to take over the TV to play
189,Currently loving it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to buy the grey one after much deliberation over which color I wanted. I've already played almost 50 hours on my favorite game and I was right to pick a neutral color to not burn my eyes on as I played. All in all, the left joystick is more loose than I would have preferred but the right one is solid and the d-pad is nice to have (missed it from the handheld era and I'm glad it's back). Highly recommended purchase if you have a game you're dying to play and you love portability."
190,My little girl loves her nintendo switch,5.0 out of 5 stars,We love our switch
191,A very pretty yellow,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love everything about my game system. No regrets at all
192,Nintendo Switch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product was a Christmas Gift for my daughter.  This was on her most wanted list and I actually told her that she probably wouldn't get it because money was tight.  (She's 17 and this is true, money was/is tight).  You can imagine the look of surprise on her face when she opened the gift and saw what was inside. She was so surprised and her father and I couldn't have been happier."
193,Nintendo Switch lite,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received this yesterday. So far I like it. My daughter has the regular Switch in her room. I thought I’d like to have one but didn’t want to hook one up to my TV since my husband is always watching tv programs. I heard there was one that was just handheld . I have always had a Nintendo handheld. I loved the 3DS but no new games out. I played it for hours yesterday. I’m an adult, a grandmother, have played Nintendo games since the 1980’s."
194,Trustworthy and great!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was skeptical about buying it online but it's in great condition! Sound works games work visuals are great love it! Dont let some of the bad reviews get you it's because they didnt do they're research on the difference between a Nintendo switch and the lite! If the the lite is what you are looking for this is a trusted source
195,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't want a regular switch because I will only be using it as a handheld device. The games I've played so far are great and the visuals are more than what I was expecting. I would rather have this over a DS any day. The only thing that I don't care for is how fast the battery drops. I guess it depends on settings but it seems like it drains rather quickly.
196,Amazing and So easy to use!,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product is amazing! Almost just like the normal switch. I love how it’s smaller and more portable than the original switch. I definitely recommend this if your a traveler and you been wanting a switch!😊
197,Pretty good,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing but it heats up faster than I would like it scuffs easily speakers are a little quiet overall great product
198,What I always wanted,5.0 out of 5 stars,I prefer the Lite version for its lack of parts (controllers) to lose or damage. It feels more like a handheld Nintendo console like my DS lite.
199,System variations or rusty player,4.0 out of 5 stars,Had it couple days and been playing some retro games and it’s been tricky to play. Not sure I’m just rusty or it’s the translation of the systems. Loving none the less
200,Nephew loved it,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for my nephew and he was ecstatic to receive it. Said he was one of the cool kids now ☺️ Cool aunt points received. Definitely worth it.
201,Cute color,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gift for my daughter, she loves it. Plays it all the time!"
202,Graphics,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, love how the graphics run, I started playing it since it arrived and I could not stop admiring the graphics in my pokemon game I played nonstop until it was time for bed."
203,Excellent purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it. Needed a new handheld after the Vita and 3DS stopped reviewing true support. I can already tell this thing will become my Vita 2.0. receives all the same indie and Japanese support as the Vita, with the added bonus of having Zelda games and various other Nintendo exclusives. If you want a handheld and aren't interested in the extra features the full Switch has, then this device is definitely worth the money. I also love the yellow color, it's so pretty."
204,No longer bored while waiting for things.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was the best purchase for someone who travels a lot. I am able to keep myself entertained on a plane and at the airport.Aside from that, it's a great portable console and you can download lots of great Nintendo games on it.I had N64 and GameCube and this is my first new Nintendo Console since those good old times, and I am happy and satisfied with my purchase."
205,Awesome! Just awesome!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for my wife, she loves it, the build quality is great! If you are using a switch for portable gaming only and don't mind the lack of rumble (like her), this is prefect, it doesn't have the wobbly feel of the OG switch in handheld (because of the detachable joy-cons), instead, it feels firm due to the full body. It has a good d-pad and works perfect to fill her Pokémon addiction."
206,"Overall, fantastic.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic gaming console. Easily replaces my 3ds as a go-to portable gaming system. Highest selling points for me are the longer battery life and smaller size for storage.I wish it came in jet black though, my only minor complaint.Also for whatever reason, there was a foreign power box in the Switch package. I'm happy my seller provided the correct adapter."
207,Works for Me,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this system.  1) it's way easier (and way less scary) to throw in my purse and drag around to work and waiting rooms, 2) it's more comfortable to hold than the Switch original, and 3) it's turquoise.  I own a Switch, too, and it's still my favorite console to date, but the SL works for me better as a portable than the Switch does, and that's all I was hoping for with this hand held."
208,Pretty good!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Man I do love these little switches , you can go on YouTube n almost everything’s..But my son dropped ha switch i the toilet"
209,Adorable and Portable,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Slow to arrive but that's understandable. Very cute, super in love with the color. Perfect for late night Animal Crossing or just watching hulu in bed because I don't want to get up. The color is very vibrant, and not as pale as the box art depicts. Once unboxed there was a clear difference in the shades, but I like what I got. 10/10 would buy again"
210,Works perfect,5.0 out of 5 stars,It has been working really good since I got it a couple months ago no problems charges fine joysticks work fine my only real issue is how little memory it can hold but that's not a problem I can easily get a micro SD card but me and my boyfriend both play on it and it works amazingly 10/10 would definitely recommend
211,Great price. Great console. Great value.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always wanted to buy a Switch Lite since launch, but sadly, in my country, the Switch Lite costs around 280. I don't know why is so expensive here, but I'm glad I got this through Amazon. The product came sealed, everything was inside the box, and in perfect conditions. Thanks to this cheaper option, I can now buy some games. If handhelds are your thing, this is a great option. Amazing price. Really happy for the purchase."
212,Great handheld device!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an awesome handheld gaming device that has access to the full switch library. The only issue I'm having with it is sharing it with my kid, so we might have to buy a second one next pay day!!!"
213,Good,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good just like the normal switch I have the the control stick came a little weird and would lag but took it apart and replaced myself but it’s been fine since then. Was a little more expensive but thats because this color was sold out everywhere at the time
214,"Great product, no issues.",5.0 out of 5 stars,My 8yr old loves his Nintendo DS light! It was really easy to set up an account for him with parental controls using wifi. I was able to add funds to thee-shop so he could pick and buy the games he wants to play.
215,Handy on long rides lol,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Another Christmas gift for my daughter and she won’t put it down lol, a little tricky setting it up for her but once we got it down, it’s a pretty neat setup."
216,GREAT!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY SWITCH! I play it almost everyday and its so easy to take on the go or if you just want to sit and play at home. I also liked the fact that it wasn’t too overpriced. These retail for $199.99 and I got mine for $236.99 which was still a great price.
217,Girlfriend is happy with it,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for my girlfriend and she’s been killing it in animal crossing ever since lol. I’d say it’s a worthwhile purchase.
218,Quarantine savior,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll be honest, when I bought this I was worried it was going to be either fake or a used unit because they are in such short supply right now. It was brand new and completely legit. It's getting me through the stay at home order perfectly.Battery life on these are garbage unless you put it airplane mode. You've been warned."
219,This is a great item.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This item has been great, my son loves it. He will set a play for hours"
220,Great delivery and product!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love this Nintendo switch,but the games is a lil expensive UWU"
221,Great but...,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s an awesome little machine and would recommend to others to purchase.Likes:Lighter than the originalNo DockLess pieces to loseDislikes:They could have changed where the charge port is located.They could have kept HDMI out functionalityThe mat finish on the device makes it feel a bit course
222,Worth it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Adorable! Works great so far, and it's actually very light in weight! Really ideal if you're looking for something smaller but still want/like the functions of the original switch. Got it as a gift for my sister so I'm happy it's working!"
223,Fun and ok,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fun little device not really my thing but was alright,would not recommend for people who have not played  portable devices since the psp its way different"
224,"Just as shown, works perfectly!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Came safely, new in box just as described and shown! It works perfect and I love it! The lite is comfortable and light to hold, and I love how the buttons feel. Thank you!!!"
225,Console Convince and Value,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've wanted a Nintendo Switch, however already owning a PS4 and using a Gaming PC I didnt want another console and I didnt wanna dish out money for a console I wouldnt use. The switch lite has the best of mobility and compatibility. I bout a grey and yellow one, for myself and my girlfriend. Both work great! Only complaint is it wasnt very hand ergonomic, but we each got a case for it and problem solved! 4/5 due to Ergo issue."
226,Great handheld,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been looking all over for a switch lite for my 7 year old son. I purchased a turquoise one for myself awhile ago and he was so jealous. I wanted to surprise him for graduating 1st grade but with this pandemic happening I was SO happy to find this and scoop it for us to play games together!! #TeamNintendo
227,More portable then full size switch,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been waiting since the original switch release date for Nintendo to come out with a handheld only version. And here it is. I'm 40+ years old. Hogging the TV for hours on a console is out of the question. But playing on the switch while sitting with the family during tv time is great. The switch lite feels much more comfortable to hold compared to the full size version.
228,The Nintendo Switch lite is amazing.,5.0 out of 5 stars,My switch lite works pretty well and has no problems while I'm playing my games. It feels like a new world of gaming consoles has opened up to me.
229,Good for the price!,4.0 out of 5 stars,My baby girl loved all the accessories but the headphones went out already and she's only had it for a month!
230,Great love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it love it love it it’s a a great system to play games on when bored im glad it’s portable my kids love it. I love playing Mario kart
231,Awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love needed something to occupy My time without burden of my phone so happy I made the purchase
232,What more could you ask for? Awesome little device,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't get the hate from many regular Switch users. If you are only into handhelds, the Lite is more than what you could ask for. Compact, light weight (man it's even lighter than the 3DS XL), good screen, and the ""joycons"" that don't break. I enjoy mine a lot."
233,Good second switch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth every penny, even if you can't dock it like a regular switch, if someone in your household already owns a standard switch, this one is a good addition for personal use."
234,Please take better care of the box of the product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I did have a good process with the delivery. Nothing was wrong there. The product was completely fine. Nothing damaged. But there was only one problem, and that was the box being roughly opened on the side. Really did not like that, but overall, as long as the product was new, it was alright."
235,I should have bought this sooner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nintendo has never disappointed me. I'm glad I got the lite too, I play exclusively in handheld mode and I think the regular one is too bulky."
236,I highly recommend,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of battery only last 1.5 hours. not 3 i have it on low brightness and volume and my friends last for 3
237,Overall very happy with my purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought the Swith Lite because I didn’t want to spend the extra money on the original Switch.I like that the Lite is more for personal use and the Original is more for group or party use.The Lite’s screen is a little smaller but it makes it easier to travel with.Battery life is a little short than what I expected.Overall very happy with my purchase.
238,Don’t buy for each kid in your home!  It doesn’t work!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We purchased three of these thinking we would buy the digital games and our three kids would be able to play them on their own Switch.  Wrong.  Nintendo makes you buy the game for each.  Even though we have a family account and my account is the primary, I can’t share games with my kids.  What a scam!  Nintendo has lost me as a customer.  These will be returned, and I’ll eat the cost of the annual online membership and unusable gift cards from Amazon that can’t be returned.  Do not buy a Switch if you are expecting your kids to be able to play on their own devices.  Whatever you think a game will cost, multiply it buy how many devices you have.  Yup, not worth it.  Nintendo knows how bad this is and yet they continue to rip you off.  Check any forum, you’ll see tons of complaints about this exact thing.  Plus, these are miserable to set up.  Trying to create a family account will take you hours because the instructions are so bad and the interface unworkable.If you have one kid and only plan to buy one Switch, it’ll probably be fine.  If you have three kids and don’t want arguing over the one Switch, you’ll want to buy three.  Unfortunately you’ll find out exactly what I did and end up wasting a bunch of money and returning them in the end."
239,“Good condition “ includes being previously chewed by a dog,2.0 out of 5 stars,And open box means doesnt even have oem charger
240,Gorgous! An amazing sidestep for us that prefer 100% portability.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Were you holding off on buying a switch due to the issues with the size and minor clunkiness of the joycons? This is 100% for you then. The size is perfect, and the weight is believe or not, lighter that a 3DS. The console is strikingly beautiful, and can easily go toe to toe with some of the best looking handhelds ever made. You won't regret your purchase at all."
241,Addict,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Husband really wanted one, even though we've already got a regular switch. He loves This so much that I almost regret buying it for him. He's on it almost 24/7. No matter where he is, it's right there with him. Even when he's not actively playing, it's sitting next to him.Nice color, feels good in the hands, nothing broken or glitchy yet."
242,All about animal crossing,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Missed the return window by 7 days. Have had it 37 days. Last night the joystick quit working to the right. Doesn't even recognize it to calibrate. Tried restarting, rebooting, didn't help. Really don't want to wait to send it in to Nintendo for repair. I have things to collect!"
243,Happy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"my daughter loves her Nintendo. It was probably one of if not her favorite gifts, ther then her bike. It arrived on time and exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Amazon."
244,Prefect,5.0 out of 5 stars,Came on time and works perfectly fine!
245,Amazing!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank God for the Switch’s little sibling! Excellent purchase.
246,"Great deal, happy son",4.0 out of 5 stars,My son is one happy kid. The Switch arrived promptly and was just as described.
247,Great escape from reality! Love the old and new games.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an adult. This is my getaway from reality. I don’t smoke, drink, and this has games I played as a kid for free. I also love the new Mario game Boosers fury."
248,Great gift,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Nintendo Switch Lites were perfect gifts for our grandkids this year.  They're sturdy and a perfict fit for middle school aged hands.  The only thing that I would change is that a game should have been included for each Switch especially considering the cost.  But regardless, they are enjoying using the free downloads and will purchase games with gift cards they received."
249,Fun,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loads of fun, I got this because the regular switch was too heavy for me to game comfortably in handheld mode for long periods of time. Lots of hours spent on animal crossing and breath of the wild, still good as new."
250,Quality of the large model/ No docking/ Smaller screen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got my girlfriend this in October for a early gift so she could catch some good releases this year, grabbed Let's Go Pikachu and gave them as a bundle gift and she was overjoyed. Pre-ordered Sword and Shield and she and I played for hours. 10/10 consider this for anyone whom enjoys Nintendo games and 3d party games. Play on and enjoy !"
251,My 10yr old loves it ! 💝,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this switch for my daughter's 10th birthday & she loves it ! She loves the color & loves how she can game on the go. Satisfied w my purchase.
252,zksbssjsjsjKewl,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like it a lot. Only wish speaker was louder for the times when I am watching YouTube or Hulu.
253,Good Gift,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have a regular switch and wanted to get my sister the lite alternative. She loves it. It shipped quickly and safely. The product is authentic and solid.
254,Amazing 👍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The device was out of stock where I live & I was happy to finally find it 😍Amazing console & it looks more amazing than the images, I definitely recommend this seller 👍*Sorry for the low quality of the attached image my phone camera is not working properly 😅*"
255,Make sure have to ddirt,4.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted for my granddaughter she loved it although they don't tell you that you have a old one
256,Great,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it. Got one for me and one for my girl.Only advice I can give to new buys is WAIT UNTIL THERES A SALE TO BUY DIGITAL GAMES. I coulda saved about $30-$50 if I had waited. Also if you’re coming from consoles like Xbox and ps4, you might wanna grab the switch case that has handles like a controller"
257,Awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this when it came out, my siblings have a switch that they wouldn’t share. So since I started working I decided to get one. I am more than impressed on how great all my games look on the screen and how great the system is. The only problem I have is that the joystick is a little noisy. I highly recommend this product."
258,It well worth the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like the carry along Nintendo  switch. It was for my 6 year old grand son he takes it everywhere  he goes.
259,Birthday gift,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves it

263,Great Product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely a great way to pass the time! I’ve been wanting a Nintendo Switch for a while, but didn’t have the money to afford the console. I purchased the lite instead and found it more appealing to me. It’s portable and great for long car rides. I definitely recommend this product!"
264,My best purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I think this is the best gift I have ever gotten myself. Super cute, fits perfectly in my hands, and offers hours of relaxation time."
265,Awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All around great!! I found one the day before at a Walmart, but with all the add ons the price was fairly close. So no complaints! Thank you, husband bought it for me as a birthday present. One day late, but well worth it!"

270,⭐️⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grate for my daughter the controls on the side don’t come off so there’s no chance of her losing it and it’s her favorite color soo that’s a plus
271,Great for everyone,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this. I got it for my niece for Christmas snd she does not put it down. This is definitely something that the whole family can enjoy.
272,"Great system, nothing detached",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I dislike the controllers not dislocating , but that’s what you get for getting the lite! I love this console and it’s great for car trips, especially with games like Pokémon or animal crossing. Can be played all day with little charging, just like a phone. 10/10 product, so worth my money!!"
273,Who doesn’t love? ❤️,5.0 out of 5 stars,Who doesn’t love their Nintendo Switch Lite? Pink for life 💕 Animal Crossing and Apex Legends girl 👧🏼
274,If you don’t want another console this is the future of handhelds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you’re not looking to add another console next to the PS4 this is a perfectly built system. One charger cord and that’s it, keep it simple.Extremely light and comfortable in hands, screen brightness and sound are good, D Pad is a much needed upgrade.Plus, you can run SNES games off it to through the Nintendo subscription. Don’t hesitate you won’t be disappointed."
275,It came quick,3.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered this for my kids for Christmas.  I am trying to get everything done little by little and I am tired of the kids arguing over the switch so for Christmas I am saving my sanity.  I am getting them lites.  This one came quick and it was still in the box.  But it will not connect to my wifi.  I am having a horrible time getting this thing to work.  here is to hoping I can get it figured out before Christmas
276,My wife loves it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my wife. She's played it everyday. She plays Animal Crossing. I asked her what she thinks so far, here's what she said. She likes it, it's cute. The screen is big enough for her. Easy to start, quick loading, only downside is battery life."

286,Love it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son absolutely loves this version of Nintendo. Great color, very lightweight, works fast and the screen is a good size. He is using it almost every day or when traveling. Yes, I wish the game progress was saved on the cartridge and not on the device but I understand that it’s the way it works."
287,Portable and Tempting but...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's great for portability, but it eventually made me obsessed with how I can transmit the image on to my TV. So I bought the regular switch. You're probably better off buying the original switch so you can play on the tv when you want."
288,"Great Switch! But this model doesn’t connect to TV, and doesn’t have a case",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the Lite Switch. But wish it can connect to TV for My Handicapped Brother. He loves his Switch Lite. But hard on his eyes on a small screen. But other than that, still a Fun Gaming System overall."
289,¡Todo perfecto!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pedí al consola desde Colombia. Todo fue perfecto. En menos de una semana recibí el producto en perfecto estado. El embalaje del producto estuvo muy bien protegido.

291,It's a nintendo product of course it good,5.0 out of 5 stars,if you can get the regular nintendo switch do it but if this is best for you or all you can afford do it.

298,Must have for the kids!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Going to get my daughter one my son loves it so much
299,Awesome complement,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an awesome complement to your Nintendo Switch because you can download digital purchases in both consoles with your main account and then play the same game at the same time in both using one complementary account (I play with my kid, so I play with my account and my son with his own)."
300,Great device. Fun to use.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using the switch lite for a little over a month and I love it. I mainly use it to play animal crossing and every thing works great. I would recommend to get a screen protector and case for protection as well.
301,Great travel console,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I prefer this over the older switch, as this allows me to take my switch and go without having to worry about charging each of the individual controllers. This makes it easier to charge and it is easier to carry and use, it is a great companion system when you go on those long trips."
302,Bueno,5.0 out of 5 stars,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
303,Problem Free!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm super pleased with this console. Everything came in one piece and on time, at a great price too! It's been 3 days and I haven't experienced any issues so far. I'd definitely recommend!"

306,It does what it’s supposed to -,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gifted this to my son. He loved it so much I had to take it away a week later because it was all he wanted to do.
307,Best console owned yet,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got it before the price increase. You get what you pay for, if you really feel like you are gonna be using the TV mode then shell out the extra 100 for a regular Switch, otherwise if you are on the move like I am, the Lite is perfect."
308,Yes!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast shipping, came in as expected!  We love our switch lite!"

348,Very portable,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is very portable little console for its power. Sometimes i would like to take a break from holding and staring at it close up by going to the TV. There was no option or adapter to connect this to the big TV. I thought the word ""lite"" would be smaller and slimmer with the same spec as the original Switch but I was wrong. This is like having a oversized 3DS that can play nintendo switch games. At the end of the day, this color makes up for it since I love pink/coral."

So I wrapped it,  gave it to my daughter as a Birthday gift, and she was quickly disappointed since you can’t use a European charger in a US outlet. It was definitely a disappointment. Then we took a trip to Target to buy a compatible charger, which was 30.00. Not the way we anticipated giving our daughter her Birthday gift."
420,fun,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Working conditions are good, came half charged which is nice. Very pleased with it"
421,Family Account Membership Nightmare,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Kids love the device. All I see is a screen the size of a smart phone with potential for enormous in game addiction purchases. Controlling accounts appears to me to be set up in a way to capture those impulse purchases and discourage parents from blocking those charges.We've had all the games, accounts... this set up for Nintendo Switch Online was impossible to do without putting financial risk into the account. Nintendo have Family Accounts and Supervision. Upon inspection, those were just cardboard cutouts pretending to be real things. Work arounds galore when you read the fine print. Use at your own risk. Bank, Credit, Paypal linked accounts couldn't be added without entering that data into childs device, which puts it into a major security issue.Will use a cheapo disposable credit card and sacrifice ability to control childs content through a Family Account in order for them to be able to play."
422,It works,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works so far. I just turned it on and made sure it worked. It’s a Christmas present

The Game Center stopped working within a few months of purchase, when I called Nintendo for repair, they tell me the units 1 year has expired, I purchased Dec 2019.  Nintendo made it right, the 2-stars are for Amazon it appears you sold a renewed game without making that clear in the add.  I’ve got 3 kids, this isn’t my 1st rodeo!In the end everything is going to workout, but it shouldn’t be this difficult."

780,Won't charge,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Garbage.  I received this on Monday and was able to play that day and Tuesday on a single charge.  When I went to plug it in on Wednesday, it didn't indicate that it was charging.  I thought it might be a glitch, so I left it charging overnight, just in case.  Well, Thursday morning comes and goes and still no charge.  I tried plugging directly into a wall and even at a completely different location.  I now have a very expensive paperweight because I refuse to purchase something else to fix an item that broke in 48 hours.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Save yourself the aggravation and just go ahead and throw this crap over a very tall bridge."

831,I wish I had bought a switch,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The switch lite was for our second child - things I have found:- It's VERY difficult to share digital purchases. Lots of lockouts between devices. Ended up setting up a second account and re-buying games- I will only buy physical switch games from now on - easier to share games between my kids- Switch Lite screen and resolution aren't nearly as good as switch- WiFi doesn't seem to work as well, despite supporting same connectionsOverall, I'm sad I got this - should have sprung for a second full switch."

857,1 month to get here.,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought it off of Amazon because I thought it would be quickly to get here. I was sooo wrong. I waited a whole month for it.The product itself is amazing. But 3 stars for delivery.
858,"Great console, bad joysticks",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Much lighter than I had anticipated but is very easy to hold for long periods of time. Unfortunately, I encountered issues with the Lite within a few days of receiving it, experiencing the joystick issue mentioned in other reviews here and elsewhere online. The Lite itself is a great unit, but it is unplayable to the extent I had to purchase a separate controller to use until the Nintendo repair centers open back up and accept repair orders. Hopefully a warranty repair will resolve the issue."

875,Nintendo switch lite,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!
876,Completely Defective,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Got it , was really excited about it and quickly found out it was defective. The L trigger button doesn't work and gets jammed.I've sent it in to Nintendo 2 times to get repaired. They claim they did it, replaced the part that was broken. Yet every time I got it back it stopped working less than an 1 hour after I started using itThe thumbsticks also feel loose and maks weird sounds and they don't move in the right wayTo be completely honest. This was an absolute waste of money, it's probably that my switch was a defective or maybe a lemon,  but it's no excuse.  I've waited over a month between repairs and still hasn't been fixed or repaired and they ( Nintendo) refuses to replace my systemI doubt I'll be buying any future Nintendo Products anytime soon, I'm a college student and was really wanting a portable gaming device to take with me around campus."

892,"This comes used, but the seller did not specify this.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"It seems to work, but it arrived with dirt on the joycons, and logged into someone else's account. When I turned it on, it was in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, I'm not sure which, I'm kind of afraid to touch it without gloves due to the coronavirus. And since the seller didn't bother telling me it was used, I don't know how much it was used, so I hope there's no drift on the joycons or anything else wrong with it."
893,Good product,4.0 out of 5 stars,Christmas gift for my son and he likes playing it.
894,Me,5.0 out of 5 stars,Haven't put it down yet one of the best things I got myself

906,PC Players!!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,If you primarily play pc games you should go for a steam deck. Nintendo is a very corrupt company when it comes to any criticism. Btw you can emulate switch exclusives on steam deck for free. Over all drop the extra money for better performance with their own games and a greater library of games available.
907,Affordable,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy. Came right on time.

968,Fun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yo... dis is fun!
969,Its ok i guess...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"the original switch felt better and i feel like it had slightly better graphics than the lite. The joysticks arent as responsive as the original either. As i feared the white is already dirty and looks ugly not sure why they couldnt give us a black option or something i hate white on handheld devices they get so dirty so fast. In less than a month my joysticks started to drift and theres no way to fix it so im stuck with a defective device!  The lack of games is the nail in the coffin for me ive played all the “good” games already and passed them,and the ones with multiplayer are mediocre at best. With no good games coming soon to the switch i feel this was a huge waste of money..."
970,it is a best toy for all!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!!!
971,Buy portable battery,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, Love!!! Battery life can be better only flaw."
972,Overheats too fast compared to Original Switch,2.0 out of 5 stars,I may of got a bad one from Day 1 but i found that this switch lite was getting hot faster than the others when it came to loading only a few games. And I am not talking about games like breath of the wild. I mean like the megaman game series .  On top of that i bought it as a seconrdary portable switch and wasn't aware that you can only have one switch tired to your profile that lets you play offline
973,Too limited to be functional with a full game library,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want to play anything besides Pokémon and animal crossing, get the full size switch so you can plug it into the TV."

990,Worked for almost a day,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was able to play problem free for a day, maybe even a day and a half, until one joystick just started turning on its own.  Over the course of the next couple days, it got worse and now it makes it unplayable.  Yet another reason to never buy anything Nintendo.  I bought this to almost exclusively play one or two games that finally were offered on it, and its just flat out terrible.  I read about the joystick problem before purchasing, but I figured over the course of YEARS and a completely new product launch (one that you cant change out the controllers on mind you) that they would have fixed it.  Nope.  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE, buy anything other than this.  Its worthless."

1043,Ordered new got used,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered a brand new switch for my Son’s birthday. Went to set it up and it was already used with a profile already set up in it. So I paid brand new price for a used switch.
1044,Joycon Drift/Broken Control Stick At The Word Go,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to replace my new Switch Lite due to broken left control stick. It suffers from all of the drift issues that is so common for this system. Nintendo is being sued for this, and is thus mostly silent until that is played out. I had used my system for less than 10 hours before realizing the stick was virtually unusable. Will be deeply upset if my replacement Switch Lite is also broken, but I wouldn't put it past it. The design on these sticks almost ensure that they will malfunction within 2 years, and as for me, sometimes right away.Edit: Second lite has now also has joycon drift after about a month of moderate playing. Let's go Amazon, I'll take a third...."

1059,Used and damaged,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Box came with fecal matter in front, and the console was slightly damaged. I assume the last user spilled water or something because the back light occasionally doesn't work and the screen stay pitch black. I bought this with a clear markup because the seller was speculating, but this is really unacceptable."

1070,Excitement faded quickly,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We were very excited to give this to our daughter for Christmas, only for the excitement to be short lived. The right toggle stopped working almost immediately without any drops, water damage, anything happening to the device on our end. It almost seems like it was refurbished and sold as new. We have dealt with it because we could use the right arrow to navigate through certain games, but now she is into racing games and it is impossible to play with this issue. Disappointed to have spent this money and get this quality of product."

1079,Is it worth it,4.0 out of 5 stars,The eshop is slow the screen is small but it's cheaper so give and take I haven't had any drifting problems but I do have problems with the bumpers every now and then it's convenient and not bad get your SD card from Walmart don't pay like 200 usd that's outrageous and have fun it's old and it's slow but it's also cheaper so it's bound to be slower

 Ok"
1117,pretty,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
1118,Better off to wait,2.0 out of 5 stars,At first I was really pleased because it only cost a little over $50 above the regular price. Then within a month it started to die pretty quickly and now it doesn’t charge at all. A major waste of money and pretty disappointing all around
1119,Great when it works,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My son received this as a Christmas present and in less than 4 months we have had to reset it 4-5 times and now it will not take a charge at all.  Nintendo said it needs to be sent in for repairs, however, the repair centers are closed.  Very frustrating that electronics do not even last 6 months..."
1120,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic
1121,Portable gaming goodness,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good
1122,Nintendo switch lite,3.0 out of 5 stars,That okay because I put sandisk memory for more digital games in Nintendo switch lite make not on. Because Nintendo switch lite not work power on
1123,Great,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wife loves it
1124,Good,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great
1125,Clunky setup and demands personal information,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I should not have to answer my email address five different times with little buttons on this console it should save the password. The sign up process is not intuitive and is asinine. I also should not have to provide any of my personal information just to use the console to sign up for nintendo. That is a violation of my rights and terrible karma for those involved with it. I should not have to waste my time writing this review either, and that too will be accounted for in hell."
1126,Euro model,2.0 out of 5 stars,We received a European model of the switch. The power cord did not have the correct plug. An adapter was sent with the switch so I could plug it into the wall. However this is not what we ordered especially coming from a place in Florida and not even shipping from Europe.
1127,Good but could be better. Not worth the price.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I did not like the battery life, and or the power. I could tell that the power was reduced from the regular switch."
1128,Great,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good thing
1129,Works great!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!
1130,200$ paperweight,1.0 out of 5 stars,This was a ripoff I was so excited when I got it has I have been wanting to get a switch for years yet within mere minutes after I had got it an was setting it up it stopped working an just started flashing the Nintendo logo nothing else works I'm going to it leave charging but if nothing changes by tomorrow  I will be returning this an expecting my money back as I bought this new be for 200$ I am never buying forum this seller again.
1131,waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,do not buy one of these. the toggles are not durable in the least. After 2 weeks the right side toggle snapped right in half and now its a worthless piece of junk. Nintendo will not cover it because they say it is an abuse/misuse issue. you will be extremely disappointed when yours breaks and your sitting there with 200.00 worth of junk. i bought this because we went through 2 sets of joy-cons with the original switch but now i wish i wouldn't of wasted the 200+ dollars. this Lite switch also has a smaller screen which is another negative.
1132,Lost interest,3.0 out of 5 stars,Played it about 12 hours never picked it back up games are low grade and cost to much
1133,What a joke!,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is how my product came! Won’t charge it came on long enough for us to see it belonged to someone named Anna! It then turned off and can’t get it to work! Never mind I had to buy a new charger for a game that my daughter won’t get to play.
1134,The package is not intact.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"No plastic layer of package, so I don't whether or not it has been used. The machine is very good though."
1135,Good product very late delivery,3.0 out of 5 stars,Product is good.  It was late by 10 days
1136,Really bad,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I can’t believe it’s like used, miss parts, miss charged, it’s broken I’m very 😞 sad"
1137,Great lite wrong fk'n charger,2.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful switch lite however quite peeved as it never mentioned it came with a European charger so we can't even turn it on. Lovely to explain on xmas. Do Not recommend GeekAlliance for sales.
1138,charger broken,3.0 out of 5 stars,charger didnt  work
1139,It stopped working 3 weeks after I received it.,1.0 out of 5 stars,It was not new . I am very disappointed and daughter couldn't enjoy it.
1140,"Doesn't hold charge after 4 months, garbage product",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought as a christmas gift early in october to beat the shopping rush. Now here in January it refuses to hold a charge any longer and past the return window. Terrible product, will not buy again. A product like this should not be dead 4 months into owning it."
1141,Left joystick not working properly,1.0 out of 5 stars,"With less than 5 hours of use the left joystick began to have a drift issue where pushing left on it would result in it moving towards the center. They didn't change the design of the joysticks on the lite model from the old normal switch model, so they all have the propensity to drift, except you can't simply replace the joycons on the lite model. Would definitely not recommend."
1142,WAIT FOR THE SWITCH LITE 2.0 JOY CON DRIFT STILL AN ISSUE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I bought the system October 3th, it arrived October 10th. Since then I have been playing 3 hours each day. Yesterday, October 13th, the left Joystick started to drift. My suggestion wait. Do not buy it right now."
1143,Extremely slow,2.0 out of 5 stars,This device is extremely slow and often freezes. Not the best birthday gift for a 4-year old!
1144,Terrible purchase,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Awful device is terribly uncomfortable to hold which is just mind blowing. Worse, Nintendo knows many consumers find their product hurts their hands and they don’t care. Look elsewhere"
1145,Asian charger instead of American,2.0 out of 5 stars,Nowhere on my order or description does it say that this Switch would come with an Asian charger instead of the American 110. Even with an adapter this is not what I wanted.
1146,Received a used,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased a nintendo switch for my son's birthday and received a used one. Confused about why I purchased something that was supposed to be 'new' but it was heavily used.
1147,Meh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Came in with no damage. so two chargers later and the damn thing won't turn on. So i sent it back for a refund and they gave me my money back without a fuss.
1148,Not a good product,3.0 out of 5 stars,Only 2 months old and it stopped working.
1149,En buen estado,5.0 out of 5 stars,Muy buen juego
1150,Damaged product,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was very unhappy with it it has scratches on it I am not pleased with this product please be mindful when sending something make sure it’s not damaged
1151,Snake oil,2.0 out of 5 stars,It was labeled as new in the description but it came without a box.  Why?
1152,Not great,1.0 out of 5 stars,Got the switch on the 2nd of march and today may 24 it has died. Will not charge will not turn on. It’s passed the return date so I’m out 200$
1153,Broken and defective item,1.0 out of 5 stars,This item is broken and the screen is blank. Also none of the buttons work. I bought this for my daughter and she didn't even have it 2 months and it's already broken. Amazon said they couldn't help me because the return and replacement time frame had expired. They told me to contact the manufacturer and see if they can help me out
1154,Only for real Nintendo Fans,3.0 out of 5 stars,Product is well made. Nice parental control features.
1155,Left analog Deadzone.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This lasted about 10 days before i began noticing a deadzone with the left analog. While playing Zelda i started noticing when i pressed forward/up on the left analog stick Link would just stop in the middle of running. Then he would start moving forward slowly, then run, then stop, then walk. Pretty much made playing any game impossible. What really angers me is the fact that Nintendo knows this issue exists. Sent Switch Lite back for refund. A pretty miserable first experience with the Nintendo Switch."
1156,Broken right out of the box.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Item broke right out of the box. Serial # on device did not match serial number on the box.We were able to contact Nintendo directly to coordinate a repair which will take 4 weeks.This was a birthday gift for my granddaughter.  To have a piece fall off the device when taken out of the box is unacceptable.  She was very disappointed as was I. This is a hard to find item so I had limited choices.
1157,Fake!!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is a fake product serial number stars with XJJ should be XKW. Box is all in Chinese and instructions are all in Chinese. This is not an original Nintendo that’s why a lot of the futures don’t work as mention in other reviews. Stay away from this one.
1158,Faulty,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Im disappointed that I received a faulty product. When I opened it and started playing on it, I noticed thay when I touch it on the sides slightly, the console will make the screen darken and brighten."
1159,Paid for new got a used,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ordered and paid for a new Nintendo switch lite for my friend's kit's and she asked me if I bought her a used one bc there were fingerprints all over it and there was a profile on it.
1160,Excellent,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
1161,Spend the extra money for the classic switch,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The switch lite I received was defective. It would not read games inserted into the console. It kept telling me it was unable to read. The only way it would work is if the game was inserted halfway. I returned this and bought a classic switch, where I had no issue with the same game. Therefore, it was not the game it was the switch lite that was defective. Just spend the extra money to get a classic switch. It’s worth the price and doesn’t feel cheap like the switch lite."
1162,Just stopped working,1.0 out of 5 stars,It just froze no response from the screen or the control pad..I should’ve followed my first mind and went to Best Buy…
1163,18 hours to download 1 game at fiber speed,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It doesn’t come with any game’s at all; not even a sample. Because possibly of cutting corners on their scaled back hardware, it takes 18 hours to download one game ( and I have 1000 gbps fiber speed ) at full price only available from one source.  Games are not refundable and come through international billing outside of the U.S.  feel free to confirm this info thru web search, users are outraged.  Terrible how they get you."
1164,Product came on time but not what I expected,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The product was very dirty such as, marks on the screen and all over even the back part of the product.  The product did not turn on when I received it. Therefore, I returned the item asap. I want my money back please."
1165,Hear that clicking? That's the sound of a fan dying 10 days in!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I want to love it, I really do. But this is the worst nintendo handheld console I've ever used. The battery is absolutely terrible, and now the fan has become super loud and clunky, after only 10 days of use! TEN DAYS!! I could buy a 200 dollar cake and make it last longer than this switch lite has. I had high hopes since our regular switch has lasted so well, but this is just a complete disappointment."
1166,Charger not working,2.0 out of 5 stars,Given to my child as a gift on Christmas day. Before the day was out the charger stopped working. Very disappointed.
1167,Just don’t!,1.0 out of 5 stars,Go to the store and buy it! Screen popped out and this was a gift for my son’s birthday today needless to say he is heart broken because this POS is being returned!
1168,Don't buy used electronics,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my kid for having good grades and after using it for 3 days, it stopped working. It wouldn't hold a charge."
1169,Not like new,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy it has pen marks on it and also has two black dots on the screen.
1170,It keeps kids safe & busy in house & not up your butt,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 9 year old niece never gets to see me & se hugs her dad so for her birthday o got her this & a bunch of games she’s so thankful & works hard to be a great kid so I became uncle of the year lolGet it for the kids it’s not to expensive & then they won’t bug you for a phone
1171,But it elsewhere.,1.0 out of 5 stars,I’m not sure if this is a seller issue or a Nintendo issue but I JUST bought my switch kite and received it on March 24th and the charger has already stopped working. I’ve ordered a new charger to see if that fixes the issue but why would it stop working after three weeks? This is a $200 piece of junk I’ve purchased so far.
1172,You shod probably check items thT are returned before you resell them!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,We bought this for my son for his 10th birthday. He was so excited. We opened it up and realized it was already used. It had another child's name downloaded with his information. Awful!!!!  Our son has special needs and we can't exactly take it back or return. Sad that this was able to be sold on Amazon again!!!
1173,the best!,5.0 out of 5 stars,i bought this for my son on his birthday and he loves it! definitely worth it
1174,Excelente diseño tamaño clmodo,5.0 out of 5 stars,

1176,Dissatisfied,1.0 out of 5 stars,I received the new nintendo switch and within 30 days of receiving it it stop taking charges so it will not charge my grandson cannot play it and then the other nitendo switch the gray 1 that I bought I've never return that 1onebut it won't take a charge you can not be played the screen won't even light up if you can respond back to me to tell me what I can do about these 2 products because right now I'm dissatisfied
1177,Dead Battery,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had this 2 months and now it doesn’t hold charge at all it goes from 100% to 0 in less than 5 minutes so I have to use it plugged in totally not worth it and it’s too late for a refund I’m super disappointed seeing as it was the only thing I bought myself for my birthday, don’t do it to yourself."
1178,The switch is ok,3.0 out of 5 stars,I had this switch for a year and a half and finally decided to upgrade to the newest edition. This switch is light and great. But the battery life SUCKS! I had to keep my switch plugged in every time I played it because the battery would only last an hour max. I highly recommend spending the extra hundred and fifty bucks to upgrade to the newest edition. Don’t settle for this one.
1179,One day out of box and will not charge,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I order this a while back before giving it to my son (I knew inventory was low and wasn't sure when/if we'd be able to get another later on). We took it out of the box yesterday and he played it for a bit today. Once it died, we plugged it in and nothing happened. The console will not charge. I'm pretty disappointed considering I paid more than what it was worth in the first place."
1180,I don't recommend this item. We have more than one that stopped working in less than 5 months.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not recommend this product.  We only owned it 4 months and it froze up and stopped working.  The device got very hot during use and started making a screeching noise, which continued until the battery finally ran dead. I charged it and it no longer turns on, it was a complete waste of money. This is not the only switch we own and more than one has stopped working in less than 5 months."
1181,Do not buy from here,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid way more then what a switch lite cost and when I got it, it looked like it was tossed out a care window going 50 miles per hour. Never buy from here please save your money."
1182,Suffers Joycon Drift,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this for my Sister so we can play animal crossing together.  4 months later she's telling me that her character moves when she's not moving the joysrick.Yup, she's got the drift.Pretty pathetic that ALL Nintendo crap is suffering from this...  Now she's out of playing til she sends it in and they fix it and I can't talk her in to sending it in."
1183,Not worth it just buy the non lite B,3.0 out of 5 stars,Joystick drift the 2day of use man
1184,Deasent,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a good handheld in all but my screen freezes up due to ""dns issue's"" but it's prabably just mine."

1187,Better products,3.0 out of 5 stars,Game are expensive
1188,Dnt buy if u have downloads,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy it buy the original one. the only plus side that it's smaller and lighter to carry around. but u need Hotspot where ever u carry it.. and some my games not even playing just says unable to start software over n over but not on the original sometime u even need internet for non dowlaodable game
1189,No Accessories?!?,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ordered the grey switch and it came in this plastic bag. NO CASE AND NO CHARGER??? This is unacceptable.
1190,Amazing product,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product and it's even better that I was able to cross the game over from my PS5 so I can get progress even while on the road.
1191,Poor charging system,1.0 out of 5 stars,The charge port has already stopped working. After reading reviews online this is a common theme with the regular Switch and the Switch Lite. For the amount of money paid this is a very poor design. Purchased on 5/1/21. Has stopped charging as of 8/20/21.
1192,Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"No games or anything, many additional charges just to get a single game to play.  Have a very disappointed 7 year old that can't play with her new birthday gift."
1193,Brand new system  stuck at logo screen,1.0 out of 5 stars,Today I finally decided to test out my new system. However I have been unable to use my purchase. Because after initially getting past the Nintendo switch logo screen a random error code appeared and it won’t return to the menu screen. However due to the virus Nintendo repair centers are understandably  closed. Therefor  I’m unable to get the system potentially fixed. Assuming it is even reparable.
1194,Don't buy as secondary console,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are buying this to use as secondary console you won't be able to play your digital library of purchased games without internet connection.  Nintendo needs to update this policy, i won't buy from Nintendo anytime soon. Ripoff, portable console that needs internet."
1195,Cannot enter eshop in the bahamas,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed . Does not have access to eshop
1196,Worthless product,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought the turquoise Switch Lite for my fiance for Christmas and it was purchased on 11/29. It's now less than 6 months later and it cannot hold a charge. We plug it in and when it appears to be fully charged we unplug it and can literally watch the battery drain. Tried a hard reset a couple of times and nothing. Sending it back to Nintendo.
1197,Disappointed!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I ordered this item for my granddaughter 10th birthday as a present to her. I was surely disappointed at seeing the item was dented and heavily scratched up. I no I purchased it used but that is just really unbelievable."
1198,Pissed!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,Soo... my switch dies after less than a year of use. I call Nintendo to find out that Amazon bought it used a few months before and advertised it new when they sold it to me FULL PRICE!!! Now I’m stuck paying $100 if I want my switch fixed. WTF?!
1199,Not impressed.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used product. Sadly badly smeared and damaged. Overheating constant. The screen has some damage that makes it hard to see the game.  I understood I was getting a new in box product when what I got was a machine that was heavily used and in plastic wrap.
1200,Doesn't support multi-user multi device,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would return this if I could. I bought this to be a second switch for my family, so that kids could play on either device. But Nintendo wants me to buy another digital copy of every game. They can only play on my account. It's really stupid, especially for a family oriented platform. Xbox does it far better."
1201,Disappointed on how dirty it is!,1.0 out of 5 stars,Can't believe that with covid and everything going on that you couldn't even wipe it off! The white isn't white white and marks all over the screen. Vary disappointed!
1202,Not very satisfied. It's a rip off,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was expecting brand new original box. Came in a priority mail envelope. Looks used, no instructions. Very upset and annoyed. Would like what I paid for. Paid $240. Not very happy. It's for my niece's birthday. Would have went to Walmart or bestbuy and paid $199"
1203,We got this for our grandchild for Christmas and only had it 3 months and now not working,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work after 3 months!I would like to return
1204,They are not new! It’s used!,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought a new switch from amazon and it was dirty when i got it and had someone else’s account on it and all their games! If i wanted a used switch lite I would of bought it and saved some money. Will be returning
1205,Can I turn it back in?,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't know how to use it, Do I Need to by some game Cards for it to play?"
1206,I hated it,1.0 out of 5 stars,It took way too long for me to receive it it was very late by almost 2 1/2 weeks on top of that the switch only worked for about a month and then it stopped working Very disappointed
1207,Does Not Last: Broken Charging Port,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Less than 6 months after I got this for my son, the charging port is completely destroyed inside. Not fixable unless you’re a master with soldering tools. Completely annoyed and frustrated for the amount of money I paid."
1208,Once it went completely dead. It never came back on. Never dropped,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This Is A Scam , My daughter can’t even use it anymore because it won’t charge"
1209,New my asss newly BROKEN,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 They are selling broken Nintendo switch lites I received mine appeared to be new but I put my Sd card in and I’m getting ready I turn it on and after the Nintendo logo comes on the screen turns black and stays black and then amazon goes contact Nintendo wow but who I bought it from"
1210,Garbage,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked for about four days and then went black. Doesn't charge, doing a hard reset didn't do anything. Tried many times. Kept it on charger for days.... nothing. Waste of money. Waited too long to return it and missed my window. Garbage!"
1211,Holds up in the wash!,5.0 out of 5 stars,500 star review- my son washed his in the washing machine. Went through a full cycle. Worked 24 hours later.

1214,Beware: NO GAMES INCLUDED!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had I known that no games would be on this device, I would not have purchased. It should at least have a few built ins at this price! Cheap construction. $60 per any game you add'nly want to buy."

1216,Excelente,2.0 out of 5 stars,Muy buen juego
1217,Foreign product!,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is foreign not backed by Nintendo! Don’t buy!
1218,left stick does not easily register 100% tilt on left stick,3.0 out of 5 stars,the unit I received requires excessive force to register 100% tilt on left stick. the problem was not solved with a calibration.
1219,I love this lil guy! Almost perfect!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying, I've played my roomie's original Switch for about 2 years. When Pokemon was coming, I knew I had to get my own. I don't even have a TV, so the Lite seemed perfect for me. And now that I have it, I love it! And let me tell you why.Pros:-Feels great in the hands, a solid unit compared to the original Switch, which makes sense because the joy-cons detach on the full size. This feels more akin to a modern mix of a Gameboy and PSP. It's lovely.-The screen is crisper than the full size Switch. Since it's 0.7 inches smaller with the same resolution, everything looks a bit less pixelated. The screen size is the same as an iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, to give you an idea.-It's compact enough to carry in my hoodie pocket comfortably. A pants pocket would be a stretch, though. And I wouldn't recommend that anyway because of the control sticks.-The battery life is solid. I haven't ever run out of power fully. While playing Pokemon Shield, it gets down to 50% in about 2 hours. It sounds short, but who games for 4 hours in a row? My arms would cramp up. And that brings me to my next point,-It charges very quickly. Even when it runs low, I find that it charges from 20 to 90ish percent in an hour. I use my portable battery pack with it, and I can confirm that it still charges while gaming with full brightness and wifi on. So I never have power issues.-The buttons feel fantastic. Having a proper D-Pad is a godsend. It just feels so...correct. The buttons have a nice click without being loud. The L and R buttons have a pleasant curve that makes it feel natural to hold. It's just...good.-The speakers are just fine. I was worried that they would be muffled or sound like crap. They aren't Bose quality, obviously, but they get the job done just fine. I've never felt the need for headphones.Cons:-The screen could still be better. Colors are good, but blacks aren't super deep. It's the same on the original Switch, and it's just a tad disappointing. I know they kept it at 720p for performance and battery, but I can't help wishing it was a full 1080p experience.-It feels a little slippery. The design is lovely, and it feels great in hand. But playing in bed or any way where it's more vertical can be cramp-y. You have to tighten your grip to make sure it doesn't slip, and it weighs on you after a bit. I use the Moko grip case for mine, which also has extra hand grips on the back like an Xbox controller. I recommend that, as it makes it perfect for holding in any position and basically fixes that issue. Still, it's a shame the console isn't a bit grippier.And my biggest gripe: No haptics or vibration. I know it would be tough to incorporate that into a solid console without shaking the whole thing, but it just makes some games less immersive/ more difficult. Some use the ""HD rumble"" to warn you of something, or enhance an intense scene. It's a shame that the Lite misses out on that. I'm confident that Nintendo could figure out how to make that work, but I doubt they will, just to separate the ""Lite"" and ""Premium"" consoles.Cons aside, I love this console! It feels like the quintessential Gameboy, the future version. Big screen, solid buttons, great graphics for a portable... and it's got that Nintendo magic. If you want to play Nintendo games and don't care about connecting to a TV, this is the one to get. I imagine it's great for kids, too. Just make sure to get a case and screen protector, so you don't have to worry about it while traveling!"
1220,Nintendo switch light doesn’t work,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I had a warrantee so I can send it back because I can’t afford to buy another one
1221,Afraid it’s broke,2.0 out of 5 stars,Unit has a clicking sound after using it for a while.
1222,Battery stopped taking charge after 24 hours.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had the Switch Lite for all of a day before the battery stopped taking a charge. Contacted Nintendo Support, but they could only offer mail-in repair after troubleshooting without any resolution. This will take up to a month to get back. Let's see if I get my money back before then."
1223,Used item passed off as new.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this item from Amazon who claimed it was new. This item was verifiably used, as there was no protective wrapping on the system, and there was already a profile created under somebody else's name. I'm pretty displeased at this fact, and will hesitate before purchasing a console through Amazon again."
1224,Something is missing......,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Where's my freaking charger at? Seriously? I have to use my Samsung charger. Just turned it on and this is what I get. People, wait until they come out at your local Best Buy and or Target."
1225,Disappointed,1.0 out of 5 stars,Got this switch for my son for Christmas 2019 and just a couple months after it decides to stop charging and Amazon won't replace it even though I'm pretty sure I had the warranty.  Nintendo switch consoles really do such. Save your money or go buy a different console like Playstation.
1226,Bought a brand new one but was clearly used,1.0 out of 5 stars,The device did not come wrapped within the box and had scuffs and smudges near the buttons indicating the device was used before hand. If it was going to be sold that way it should have been cheaper in price
1227,Didn’t last 3 months!,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Switch started turning itself off on its own.  Then it wouldn’t stay on for more than a few seconds.  It doesn’t work at all now and it is a few days past the return window.  Not happy with how mush we spent and how long it lasted!
1228,Broken controller,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It was great and really did look like new as described, however the left joycon is unresponsive enough to hinder gameplay drastically as well as making a clicking noise. It seems like its out of place or something. Games like smash ultimate would be impossible to play due to the broken controller."
1229,Worked great for 6 months,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great for about 6 months, then it stopped holding a charge.  I did a hard reset and nothing worked, I sent an email to Nintendo and still haven't gotten a response back.  It's a shame because the graphics were great and my 6 year old loved playing it."
1230,"I'd spend the money for the regular version, not the lite.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Spend a bit more and get the full version.  You won't regret that, this is fairly limited.  Might as well just play games on my phone."
1231,Not a good console,1.0 out of 5 stars,The seller is great. Everything arrived on time and in good condition. However the Nintendo switch lite is a broken console and only a month after using it I have had to contact Nintendo to send it in for battery repairs
1232,Be Ready to Return It,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Mine came with a defective left joystick, and I’ve heard of numerous other issues."
1233,Too much money for what you get in return,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product is nothing more than a money scam the advertisement showed this device with kids playing many difrint games. Don't be fooled it comes with no games. You can perches games of a very limited selection at a high price the good games are 60$and up
1234,I want my money back PLEASE,1.0 out of 5 stars,The pink switch for 199.00 got so hot it burnt my daughter and had to be put outside. I took the batteries out. I need to return it.
1235,Poor Quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor quality item, zipper and handle broke off in less then two weeks. Would not recommend to keep Nintendo switch safe."
1236,Stopped working before a month,1.0 out of 5 stars,We haven’t had this system a month yet and it’s already stopped working. Will not charge at all. Very unhappy with this purchase.

1238,Misleading,1.0 out of 5 stars,Switch came with UK adapter was totally blind sighted that I would be sent a European version I cannot use the charger. Very frustrating I hope this model is compatible once I figure out how to get it charged.
1239,Japanese writing on the box and no English language so you could not read instructions.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t like it was not in the English language

1241,Device is not working,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You sold a broken device that worked only for 5 months, I don’t recommend this seller for anyone, it’s a fraud"
1242,SCAM,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not purchase from this seller. Cartridge reader stopped working first day. They made me pay for return shipping then told me there's nothing wrong and refused a full refund and it still doesn't work.
1243,Does not work! Money back or replacement!,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my grandson for xmas. It worked for only 2 months. That is PURELY UNACCEPTABLE!

1244,Disappointed this time!,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered a NEW NINTENDO SWITCH. What I got was a used one and there wasn’t a charger with it either. Screen was all fingerprinted up. Obviously not new.

1247,Better than the full size for portable gaming but miss docking function,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the regular switch at launch then when animal crossing came out we got the lite to have two islands.  The lite feels way better.  It is lighter and feels more ergonomic in my hands.  I can game longer with it.  I really wish Nintendo would make a pro-lite that can dock, then I would have the best of both worlds.  I really like traveling with the lite, but I miss being able to see the extra detail on a large TV.  It is not easy to move saves back and forth so I have to make a choice of where to play my games either lite only or the regular switch heavy switch that stays in the dock mostly.  If you play mobile most of the time the lite is a great console.  It would be a dream for a docking lite. small portable and full screen gaming."
1248,Defective,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nintendo Switch was made defectively. Thankfully Nintendo is repairing my Switch at no cost to me, but still, it was a hassle to go through. New game systems should work. A lot of money for not so much quality. 👎"
1249,Did not work,1.0 out of 5 stars,It would not work I had to return it and bought one from target instead
1250,Do not least,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good to buy junk
1251,Great device!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall a good device. Recently upgrading to the regular Switch as I deal with pain in my neck and head due to looking down on the device. Due to muscle weakness, I also get sore arms soon after I start to play. I wanted a device that I can hook up to the TV.But for everyone else if they don't have these issues, this is a great device!"
1252,Nintendo switch lite,1.0 out of 5 stars,I just would like to say that it's wrong for Amazon to sele me a used Nintendo switch lite when I perched a new factory seald one..
1253,Perfect for a college student like me!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my Switch Lite. I had both the regular Switch and this console and for my own purposes and interests, I decided to pass on my Switch to my siblings and bought myself a brand new Switch Lite the moment it came out. Sure it might not have HD rumble or detachable joy-cons, and yeah it doesn't connect to a TV screen well, but as a full-time college student who desperately tries to keep up with Pokemon, this was a must-have. I'm out and away from my apartment more often than not and having a small device that 1) fits in any bag I'm wearing, 2) is not heavy as hell on my wrists, and 3) is on the cheaper side is a miracle in that of itself. The Switch Lite works exactly as my normal Switch did and, as an added bonus for being a little smaller and a little less dense, has just a little bit more battery life than the normal console. Also, I must say that these Switch Lite colors are way more appealing to me than some of the Switch colors.I'm no hardcore gamer or collecter, so I see no need to spend an extra $100 on features that I won't even get around to using or will even remember exist. I play on long bus rides to school, while I'm waiting for classes to start, or in the comfort of my bed. If you're thinking of buying the Switch Lite just to collect or to use as I would then sure! Yes! Go for it! If you're thinking about buying the Lite as a device to switch back and forth between this and a regular Switch... I'd highly advise against it.The Switch lite is purely for casual gameplay and for convenience, so don't buy it knowing fully well that's what its for and then complain that it doesn't ""work as well"" as the regular Switch. The entire time I've had my Lite, I've had no problems with it and I'm sure once you get yours you'll love it just as much as I do."
1254,Idk it was too weird..,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this for christmas but thought it was too weird.. why did it have like, buttons and stuff on it... wtf is that lol i threw it away my mom doesnt know"
1255,#freesmash,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered this before nintendo cancelled the smash tournament, unfortunately. I won't be purchasing any games for it."
1256,Nintendo switch,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a replacement for the first one, but after 2 weeks of playing, it broke again. It no longer charges or turn on. It’s completely dead."
1257,Missing device,1.0 out of 5 stars,Came without the device. Only the charger was in it. The box look damage when I receive.
1258,Dont not buy save your money!!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had this piece of junk for a like month and the left joy stick just started drifting by itself was really hoping that wasn't gonna happen to soon :(
1259,Don’t buy!,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t stay connected to WiFi for anything. Doesn’t stay charged and updates constantly. I will not buy again.
1260,Forever and have to pay return shipping.,1.0 out of 5 stars,I hate how hard it is to return takes forever. If you dont need to return it then the item is ok the box was slightly damaged though.
1261,No sirve el cargador,1.0 out of 5 stars,Enviaron un cargador de otro país aquí en EUA no sirve
1262,Dont be misinformed by the negative reviews this system is awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Im gonna discredit alot of the reviews on here because ive seen alot of people say this hand held is useless. IT IS ANYTHING BUT USELESS, the problem those customers are having is all their games is linked to one account (normally the parents account) because of this you cant share games. It isnt about which type of switch you get because all of them work in this manner. If you go in and blindly purchase a product without investigating it first than thats on you. Theres plenty of info to be found on this device through youtube if your unsure about this product. Nintendo does NOT hide anything about this product and even if they did then youtube would well inform you about it. This is a great system for a great price. Its got a great selection of games and a great battery life, it also feels good in your hands and has a sleek display. Again if you want to have multiple systems and play the same game than that game has to be bought through the accounts you wish to do multiplayer on. You cant just buy it on one account and assume that now you can play it on every other account you've created because yes that is a form of piracy because you only bought the game once and expect it to play on several other sytems with accounts that didnt purchase it. Thats like saying i bought it once now i want several copies of it for free. Im sorry i know im rambling but if you owned something and were selling it would you be okay with selling one copy and giving several more copies of your product away for free? Trust me when i say this is a great system and whenever im looking for a great gaming experience this is my go to. I hope everyone enjoys this system as much as i do."
1263,Drifting Already,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I started using it on Saturday and it's already drifting today on Wednesday. So disappointed as I love this console a lot. What's with that, Nintendo?"
1264,I need help now!,1.0 out of 5 stars,System stop working 03/20. Unable to send in for repair due to covid-19.  Hope they will still honor 1 year warranty once they resume.
1265,the perfect switch for one person,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I went for the switch lite because of the color and the fact that it was $100 cheaper than the original switch (because it doesn’t have joycons, a kickstand, or a dock which means it can’t connect to the TV) but a month later I’m still happy playing animal crossing on it. I would definitely recommend this if handled gaming is your style. Just make sure you check that the games you want support handheld mode."
1266,Nite do switch lite,1.0 out of 5 stars,I just got my new Nintendo switch that I Pay Koran than it usually cost. And I came with a yellow mark on the screen.

1268,Great while it lasted,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My son purchased one of these for his daughter last Christmas. Less then a year later, it doesn’t work! He’s taken it several places to get it repaired…no one can fix it!! I’m not sure if he got the protection plan or not, but, it should have lasted more then 10 months. If you purchase this, make sure you get the protection plan , otherwise it’s not worth the money!!"

1272,It was from a different country.,1.0 out of 5 stars,They sold me a European Switch Lite with a sketchy AC converter. I'm from the US and want a US console.

1282,NO Power cord!  NOT NEW!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,MISSING POWER CORD!!!  Item was not new.  Box unsealed and switch not in plastic.  Be honest in item description!
1283,Best video game purchase in a long long time,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I just so happened to be at the Nintendo store in NYC on the launch day for the Switch Lite.  I bought a Lite on a whim and haven’t put it down since.  As a mobile experience I find the Lite superior, its super lite weight and a single piece.  There is no wiggle with the controllers compared the regular Switch and the unit is much smaller and lighter without giving up too much screen size.  The screen is about 0.7 inches smaller but it doesn’t really feel too different.  Also images are sharper because its still 720P yet on a smaller screen.You can’t really do an apples to apples comparison between this and the regular Switch because they have different goals.  If money were no object I would have a regular Switch for home use on the TV and use the Lite for on the go gaming.  Of course I would need a Nintendo Online account for cloud saves.There seems to be some confusion and unwarranted 1 star reviews regarding how licensing works when you have multiple Switches.  In fact its no different than Xbox.  Whatever Switch is deemed your main device will play all your digital content no matter who is using it, however your second device requires the user who purchased the software to login for permission to play a digital title.Since I already knew this I try to get physical cartridges whenever possible and limit my digital purchases.  In fact that’s why gamers like physical media for just this reason, the cartridge is the license and thus can be borrowed, traded, sold, etc"
1284,Probably another scam,1.0 out of 5 stars,so far it won’t read any of the games I’ve got smh
1285,great!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"after a few months of use, it still works! perfect!"

1287,Flawed product.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely disappointed. Less than two hours of gameplay and there’s already a problem with the touch screen that makes the system basically unusable.
1288,Check the vendor before buying,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product was made for Europe not the US. Buyer beware of this third party vendor
1289,Let down,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wouldn’t power on
1290,Not new as advertised,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product was advertised as new but arrived unsealed and obviously previously opened. This should be classified as used or opened.
1291,KEEP LOOKING,1.0 out of 5 stars,The box had already been opened.. And the charger doesn't work. I shouldve ordered through gamestop.
1292,Charger isn’t from US,1.0 out of 5 stars,They sent me a charger for needs an addition adapter from Europe. The charger barely charges the game
1293,Que no he recibido mi articulo un Nintendo swich,1.0 out of 5 stars,No lo he recibido y supuestamente lo entregaron el 1 de junio y aquí no ha llegado
1294,Arrived broken.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of only a few bad experiences I’ve had, dealing with Amazon. The product was broken on arrival. Very disappointing for my daughter to open her birthday present and, it not be a working product. Very disappointing. My 9 year old daughters birthday, was ruined."

1296,Best Christmas Present,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this as a Christmas Present from my family😍😍 I was surprised because I was not expecting it. The first time I ever laid my hands on a switch was when my brother got his and I played through and finished Zelda Breath of the Wild and played Mario Odyssey, Links Awakening, Super Mash Brothers, and Mario Kart 8, and then it was announced Nintendo would be releasing a Switch Lite. I got the Turquoise Switch Lite and the Zelda Breath of the Wild leather Case. I was given Spyro the Dragon Trilogy which I remembered from the time we owned a PS Console, and I got Mario Maker 2 and Luigis Mansion (which I finished the entire game and it was the coolest). Only downfall is when you want to download games it takes awhile😭 and the battery life dies out but it does charge quickly and it comes with a plug in charger. Also love the fact that you can sign up for an account to play a full library of Nintendo and Super Nintendo games which I have 🙆🙋😻 Can't wait for Zelda Breath of the Wild 2. And I do hope they can continue to crossover more games from PlayStation over to Nintendo Switch like Call of Duty and Madden Football 😔 You can play against other players online. It's the best."
1297,"breaks, just stops working",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Broke, 3 times"
1298,don’t buy,1.0 out of 5 stars,Charger stopped working in 1 day of having the switch waste of money
1299,This will be addictive to play with,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVED this! Before I had this, I was playing on the 3DS, but this is so much better and more accessible."
1300,Item defective,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used for 10 minutes. Screen stopped working.
1301,As Described,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast Shipping and Good Packaging
1302,Very pleased,5.0 out of 5 stars,The switch came on time as promised. On time.  Very pleased with the item
1303,Warning,1.0 out of 5 stars,This divice broke after just a few days of use.
1304,"Brand new, fast arrival",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works perfect. My son loves it.
1305,Misleading,1.0 out of 5 stars,Is this product used or new?
1306,Love 💕 the pink lite version😍😍,5.0 out of 5 stars,So my reason for making this purchase was  because everyone at work was talking about animal crossing and obviously there ain’t sh1t to do because of being “quarantined” 😂🙄. I decided what the hell and try it out and it’s addicting! So I saw this lite version was coming out and I ordered it from Walmart the morning it was released lol veryyy lucky after I saw the ridiculous prices on eBay! 😂😂🤦🏼‍♀️I have the regular switch but I seen the switch lite was coming out in CORAL and that’s basically pink to me and I wanted something that wouldn’t kill my hands playing animal crossing for hours on end. I love it! It’s more of a pink color and I’m sooo in 😍 with it!
1307,reminds me of when I had a game boy color,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this. Love love love it. It is exactly what I have wanted from Nintendo for so long. The Switch is cool, don't get me wrong, but it almost feels too cool? I guess it has its time and place, but when I want to play games on the go (on an airplane, a train, traveling) this is just exactly what I need. After I had the Switch for awhile I actually bought the 2DS XL because I wanted something portable, and I know it is old, but the graphics are atrocious and I hate the two screens. This really brings me back to the game boy color of my childhood that I cherished. I'm so excited Nintendo released this and have been having so much fun since I bought it."
1308,"It is a good replacement for my Vita, and I freakin' loved that thing!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Game options are great, old and new, fantastic game support (unlike Vita), form factor is great -- I bought a case that helps with ergonomics -- it's just overall a great great system.  I mourned the obsolescence of my PS Vita, and this has really helped.  I like how structurally solid the Lite is, some devices have too much flex.  And because I don't like playing games on my TV, this device is just perfect.  (Not to mention its portability.)  What can I criticize?  It's definitely not a replacement for an internet device, I think the avatars are a bit silly, battery life can always be better (but it's probably for the best. ;-))."
1309,Will not charge,1.0 out of 5 stars,Will not charge anymore. Customer service is horrible.
1310,Questions...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I haven’t ordered this item yet since I’ve only ever use a Nintendo 3DS...so I have questions.... does 3DS game work on switches? Does it take long to charge? And does it work without WiFi? But I’m gonna give this item a 5 star review because it seems good! 🖤
1311,Defective,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stick drift
1312,Exceeded expectations,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you exclusively want handheld mode than this is for you. It’s a one person device so remember that. I personally bought it for these purposes. It puts you in your own world when you have downtime.
1313,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing. I like it so much better than the OG switch (Mainly because I'm out and about a lot so this is useful for me). It is lite (hence the name), the battery life handheld does last longer than the OG in handheld mode. Honestly if your out and about a lot, this is for you."
1314,"good and not good, Ill explain.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Im not all that into portable gaming as I never go anywhere with my gaming but stay at home and play on my 55” 4k tvs.  I had the 1st switch and it was great to play Mario on a 55” tv but it didn’t last long as I lost interest because I have a ps4 also with a lot better games so I sold my switch.  Also the portability was ok,  the system was super bulky to hold in your hands and heavy to hold up for long times.  So the lite version is kinda same way though not as heavy but still has weight to it and the grip ability and ability to hold in hands comparability is not possible. Im used to a ps4 or ps5 controller and gaming for hours at a time, I cannot play hours on end with the lite in my hands its not comfortable.  So im going to buy a docking stand and someway to connect a different controller.  Overall the switch lite is just what it means smaller, lighter, no HDMI support for tv playing.  so for ABOUT $100 less than the full switch well its up to you if you dont mind it being only played on the small screen.  I dont know how long ill keep my switch lite.  for portability the screen is pretty big compared to past Nintendo portable gaming handhelds.  O dont forget the battery life is better than the full switch but its still not as good as it should be.  Improvements are needed to say the least but nothing is perfect."
1315,Very fun good product,5.0 out of 5 stars,It must feel amazing to own one of these.. I wish.
1316,Love my coral switch!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love mine! It’s small and compact. At first I thought I wanted something not to be docked. Or eventually I will dock it but I wanted a small switch. But over all I love mine! Play it everyday! Just now looking for new games to play!
1317,Good for RPGS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, got around to getting a member for the Switch family and chose the Lite since I don't have access to a TV and to save money. Have enjoyed playing Odyssey, Fractured But Whole, and Link's Awakening on it and looking forward to playing Stick of Truth."
1318,Great and probably their best!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I own a Switch with now the Switch Lite and I have to say I stopped playing my Launch Switch altogether and probably will sell it. This is the perfect size and fit for me. Great Job Nintendo. I'll be buying my 4 year old one.
1319,Love Love LOVE!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is such a beautiful and fun console! I’m extremely satisfied with this item, it’s honestly perfect! All the fun of the OG switch but half the price! Perfect for the gamers on a budget or for those mainly interested in hand held gaming :)"
1320,Price,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gave it 5 because there is nothing wrong with the product itself.  But what I want to know is why the price went up $100 on the official website it’s literally the same $199.99 and the MSRP in the description is also 199.99
1321,Gift,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what we ordered and works perfect. Very happy with the game.
1322,A portable game console that isn't portable or fits in your POCKET,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They made a version to be more portable and more affordable, well its more affordable but it still doesn't fit in your pocket. Can someone please make a portable game console that isn't 11 -15 years old that actually is practical to always have in your pocket? There are tons of android game controllers, but those dont fit in pockets either. The last portable game console was the psp go. Before that, the gameboy micro. That is about it as far as truely pocket friendly game consoles. The vita and new 3ds are really pushing it as far as being practical to always have in your pockets. They just are a little bit too heavy and big. Then this, the switch lite, is even heavier and bigger than those last gen options which were already too heavy and big. I guess I'll keep sticking with my psp go for now.If you don't care about portability, i.e. size and weight, just get a regular switch. I just don't get this product, sorry. Do you really need to save $50 to lose a bunch of features and neither device is practical for your pocket?"
1323,Don't buy if you want to share with multiple people,5.0 out of 5 stars,Listen if you're using family sharing or you want to use a tv with this don't buy this it's a handheld only device meaning a single player only device think of this the same way you thought about the 3ds portable and comfy!
1324,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the portability the solid color it was easy for me to transfer all my data over. I received this as a gift for Christmas I did want the Pokémon edition one but Nonetheless it’s a amazing device
1325,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it
1326,Form Factor Is KING,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the OG Switch but this is amazing for portable play! the site is basically a switch minus one joy con, and it just feels great in your hands. A must if you play portable mainly!"
1327,Bad,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad.
1328,thinking about buying,5.0 out of 5 stars,too many bad reviews!
1329,Nothing,1.0 out of 5 stars,Plain
1330,Simply Beautiful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very pretty and controls work great. One thing I notice people saying is that Lets Go doesnt work well with handheld, which I completly disagree with its more easier to throw by simply pressing A."
1331,Really cute Switch lite,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the fact it's smaller and I can play all the games I like from the original switch.  I will play this more then I played the original switch just really convenient.
1332,Boyfriend loves it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a person who is extremely into gaming, this is definitely the perfect gift. Portable device, can take anywhere, most regular Nintendo Switch games work with the Lite device. Worth every penny!"
1333,Come With Games,5.0 out of 5 stars,This item im I hope it comes with games insude the box
1334,Awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 8 year old daughter loves it. It’s slightly smaller than the Switch. Smaller screen appears to make the graphics better than the Switch.
1335,The game,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought the system and a game and it said the game would come in the system but I cannot find it
1336,Update after christmas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Revived but will not be used until after Christmas. Update will be madeUpdated. My 6 year old is happy!!
1337,High quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is amazing it's high quality and touch it was a bit pricy but it was definitely worth it!
1338,Love it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Came brand new as expected! It works perfectly and so does the charger. I would definitely buy this again.
1339,Perfect buy even for adults,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ordered this July 3rd received July 8th. Quick shipping and new! Already started playing Animal Crossing 😜
1340,Why is the AC adapter so big?,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s pretty nice, very light and feels better in your hands than the regular Switch. You will be sacrificing certain games that either won’t work or are impractical for not being able to connect to a tv or have joycons. It still seems to have the fragile Switch design, which is sad because every product before was absolutely bulletproof. This has a sleek screen but you are going to worry about damaging it (never happened to me but I feel like you have to be way too careful than you should be with a portable system). But my biggest gripe of this is the AC adapter which is huge and weighs probably more than the system itself. It won’t fit in my official Nintendo case and given it’s supposed to have only 6 hours of juice (which is better but far from good) you are going to need to lug it around with you."
1341,Parents be warned,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have multiple kids and you want to use the download games on two with the same account at the same time you CAN’T! I did the research looked up if games could be used on the same account on multiple devices got yes across the board but what wasn’t mapped out is the dirty little secret you can’t use them at the same time as the other switch. If the main account connects anywhere else the lite gets disconnected and can’t play. The whole reason I got it was so my youngest could play but only with downloaded games no cartridges because they would be more likely to take them out and lose them. So now I have to spend hundreds more to get more?! Even though I just spent 600$ to get this game, joy con and two more digital games ?! Nintendo should be ashamed."
1342,Fun but overpriced and bad security system.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My family has been buying products from Nintendo forever. Most recently I bought a Nintendo Switch Lite (as these were much too expensive). I used it for about two months and I absolutely loved it. Then my Switch Lite was stolen from my house. My mom told me she would get me a new one as it wasn't my fault it had been stolen, but only for its original price. I had originally bought it from Target for $199, as I'd gotten very lucky in finding it because they flew off the shelves once they were restocked. For another month I checked and checked Target, but nothing. Eventually I was so bored and sick of checking that my mom agreed to pay the extra $40 from Amazon. In all honesty Nintendo taking advantage of bored consumers and price gouging isn't okay."
1343,The screen is just too small for the games I like to play - don't make this the only Switch you own,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a big library of 3DS games and thought the Switch Lite would finally be the evolution to handheld modernity I needed. Well, boy am I disappointed. The system itself seems great and I have no complaints about that... but it turns out the types of games I like to play (menu heavy or with lots going on with the screen) the font and detail sizes are just too small on the 5.5 inch screen. For example I try to play Fire Emblem I swear the fonts are size 4 (in some places, and the avatars are so tiny I can barely tell what's going on.Switch games are designed with the TV in mind, and if it doesn't work well on your portable, that's an ""oh well,"" since you can just plug it into your TV. Except if you're like me, and only have a Lite, you can't do that. Now I have a couple hundred dollars worth of useless games. Guess I have to get the OLED version when it comes out (for another 350!) so I can actually use them and have the handheld experience I deserve. So disappointed. -_-"
1344,People this this is an extension a switch they already have...,3.0 out of 5 stars,People keep trying to dog this console because of games they downloaded on the normal switch wont play.... of course nintendo is not going to allow you to use games you bought on different account at the same time. You need 2 copys of the game its always been like that... & should be i mean your playing 2 copys of the game why would you not have to buy the 2nd copy its your fault for being lazy AF not buying physicals version
1345,Huge software issue by Nintendo if this is your secondary console!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are purchasing this as your secondary Nintendo switch or share games between family members, you'll be very disappointed.Sharing digital games between multiple systems sucks. You can set one console as your primary, allowing you to play games anywhere without an internet connection. But to play digital titles on secondary systems, you'll have to be connected to the internet and it's also authenticated every three hours. Even worse, you can only play games through the account that originally purchased them. That's a problem for families where one parent account typically buys digital games.The Switch is meant to be portable. I ended up having to make it my primary system to play digital games on the go. But that also meant my original Switch was basically trapped on the dock under my TV. I was forced to restart progress on games that don't support the Switch Online's cloud saves.Family members wouldn't be able to play anything on the docked Switch on their own accounts. They'd be forced to play under my username, which could be a problem when it comes to managing saved games. And, worst of all, they wouldn't be able to play any of my digital games on that system offline.While multi-Switch households could swap around physical game carts, that introduces a whole new set of problems, especially with kids. Physical games can easily be lost or damaged, and you'll also have to be more mindful about trading games between systems. That's particularly true with the Switch, since each system might be traveling with a different person, instead of being set up throughout your home. Carts are also just annoying to plug in -- sure, that just takes a few seconds, but it's not nearly as seamless as booting up a digital game.The biggest problem with limiting yourself to carts? It's kind of impossible on the Switch, since it has a robust library of indie titles that are only available digitally. As much as I'd love to see a cart for Untitled Goose Game, it's not worth waiting around to see if one ever appears. Digital games are basically an inescapable problem for every Switch owner."
1346,Only for a casual switch fan,2.0 out of 5 stars,"While I may not have purchased this product, I have done my research on the system to get a valid point on this mini console. Starting off with the retail price of $200 is too much if you want to be able to enjoy the switch library. What I mean by this is that the switch light doesn’t have the detachable controllers (joycons) that many games NEED to be able to play. An example of this would be just dance or super Mario party. A pair of joycons is roughly $80 and then you have to buy a joycons charger for them because the lite can’t charge them so your looking at around $310. At that price you should have just spent the money on a regular switch that is superior to the lite in almost all ways. That being said, the switch lite is good for kids that want to play one or two games on a switch. If you wanted to fully dive into the switch library then I would suggest a regular switch because it is still portable and it can connect to the tv ( lite’s can’t do that) and it has better battery life. My final problem is about the joysticks on the switch lite and the regular switch’s joycons. After a while of use, the joysticks start to drift ( move without any input) witch can really damper someone’s experience with a game. Nintendo offers free repairs in certain parts of the US but if this happens with the lite ( it will happen eventually) you would have to send in the entire console just to get the joysticks fixed! Overall I feel like this console is good for people who want to play a few games on the switch that don’t care about seeing them on a tv."
1347,"Awesome console, awful, draconian DRM",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Getting this as your only switch? Have fun - it's cute, it's light, it's absolutely fine. Most/all of your games are physical? Enjoy!Getting this as a second Switch? Unless you're going on a purely physical games route DON'T DO IT. I can't stress this enough. Honestly, I thought the naysayers are over-exaggerating and it couldn't be that bad, right? Wrong. It's much worse than expected:The DRM is quite draconian and requires an Internet check for every single E-Shop game, and a constant connection throughout your gaming session. Worse still, I have multiple accounts which I buy from, so I'm forced to try and remember the exact account which I bought the specific game from otherwise the game won't even start. The process goes like that:""Hmm, I feel like a bit Binding of Isaac this evening. Where did I put the Lite? Ah, here it is. Connect it, run the game, the check takes a few seconds...nope, that's not the account that bought it. Was it that account?....Still nope. I could have sworn it was on this account! No? Damn it, which account was it?!"" If this was just a few games it wouldn't be that big of an issue. I have about 60 digital games spread over 8 different accounts downloaded to 1TB SD Card. I hope you see the problem here.But do you think that's end of it? It goes even lower than that: I sometimes bought games on one account, and their DLC on another. This means that I can't play these games with their respective DLC's unless I buy either the game or its DLC's again on one, specific account. The Lite feels like an expensive brick now.This is a shameful, completely customer unfriendly attitude by Nintendo, and no amount of apologetic brown-nosing fan service will change that. We're being treated like thieves for legitimately buying digital games. I'm being forced to purchase physical from now on if I want to play properly, but I'm having a hard time even justifying buying more games at this point.You have been warned."
1348,Dreaded joy con drift!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This switch lite was purchased from Amazon as a Christmas gift.  It wasn't put into use until mid January.  About a week ago the joy stick started to malfunction.  It's intermittent, sometimes starting right away, sometimes not starting till you're playing about 20 minutes. Sometimes it's not too bad,  and sometimes you can't even control the character which is horrible. Called Nintendo couple of days ago and the man emailed me a return label.  They are not even fixing the joycons on the original switch, just sending replacements.  He did say that because it's a switch lite they would try to fix it, but they might have to replace it.  It's the Pokemon special edition version and he said they would NOT be able to replace it with that version.  That's the first issue.  Another issue is that it has 2 large unfinished game saves, Links Awakening and Pokemon Sword. They're saved on the internal memory of the hardware (why oh why can't we save on an sd card,  Nintendo.  Oh that's right we're supposed to buy cloud service for saved games,  but wait,  Pokemon can't be saved on Nintendo online service)  so if they have to send a replacement machine what happens to all the saved data? He said they would certainly try to port the data to the replacement switch,  but he really didn't make any promises. Great.  So now what to do?  Maybe forget sending it back and just buy a different controller. That certainly makes the lite less portable.  And shouldn't your hardware just work? I would really like Nintendo to solve this problem but I'm very concerned about sending it back to them. The switch lite seems like a great idea but because of this joycon problem I cannot recommend it at all.  If you do buy it, put it thru it's paces right away so you can return it if yours develops the issue.  But who's to say this problem wouldn't happen as soon as your return window closes."
1349,Proceed with caution! It’s Disappointing!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had/have an original and bought this to see if I might like it more since I find the normal switch a bit too big for portable play.First off, people leaving perfect scores on this product are either lying or just trying to justify their purchase. If you have very small hands then this item with be just okay. A kid will like it because if the colors and won’t mind the atrociously cheap/hollow build quality.This is literally the cheapest feeling console nintendo has made to date. The 3ds xl, 2ds xl, gameboy advance, ds lite... all of those have better build quality and buttons. Most people who reviewed this item online lied about or didn’t mention all the negatives. So here I am!Pros:You can play switch gamesIt’s cheaper than a regular switchThere are colorsCons:UncomfortableFeels like a cheap knockoff consoleHorribly mushy buttonsHorrible system transfer process (also on normal switch)Horrible game sharing process (also on normal switch)Comes with an unnecessarily huge chargerYellow-tinted screen when compared to OG switchReally bad sound due to speaker locationNo stand (yes, that’s a con)Big bezelGets hot fasterConsidering what you get for $200... it’s a ripoff compared to a normal switch."
1350,Great system - BAD repair options.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Our joystick crapped out after a few months - works intermittently. The repair option? 5-7 weeks to ship and repair.  My son didn't like the sound of that - so we're dealing with it.  Bad customer service - but my son loves it so much - so, we're screwed with a busted switch lite.  Bummer."
1351,"What a ""switch"" in Nintendo quality",2.0 out of 5 stars,"The first switch lite I bought the screen went black after a month and I had to return it. The second one that I use currently has a random lag in the left joy stick...The 3ds was durable, gc, SNES, 64 Wii, gba were all very tough systems.... This.... This is trash.Since the vita died this is my only hope for portable RPGs so I'm stuck."
1352,Horrible D-pad,2.0 out of 5 stars,"if one of your main purpose to buy this system is to play fighting games (like Street Fighter and SNK -or Neo Geo- fighting games), you will be majorly disappointed with Nintendo Switch Lite's d-pad.  If you are NOT planning to use the d-pad for diagonal directions (like Super Mario games) THEN I do recommend Switch Lite."
1353,Used & Dirty!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ridiculous! Got this as a gift! Completely been used like it has no life left in it! For that price is a ripoff! Packaging was horrible! Literally came in a usps box with paper stuffed inside. No bubble wrap or anything to secure the switch. There are smears, scratches and dirt everywhere on the product. Very disappointed!"
1354,Bait and Switch,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The switch works just fine, but for the collectors out there do NOT buy. This isn’t the North American console—they’re sending the Thailand/Philippines version."
1355,It's a piece of junk.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The system is a piece of junk. I went through two Nintendo Switch Lite consoles, and both of them burnt out in just over a month. The first one I figured was just bad luck, but when a second one burns out as well... Then it's not just bad luck... It's a problem with the system itself.I recommend anyone considering getting one of these, to run in the opposite direction, and seek out a completely different brand of handheld or console system."
1356,Gee thanks for taking my money,2.0 out of 5 stars,When it worked it was great but totally killed the battery after a machine reset glitch hit us. Only lasted a month. NOT MENT FOR LONG HOURS OF GAMEPLAY
1357,Good console. Charger sucks.,2.0 out of 5 stars,The console itself is fine. But this came with a foreign electric plug and an adapter. Which makes the plug in be 3 inches long and heavy so it falls out of the outlet.
1358,Screen is too small.  Buttons suck.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"There are too many switch games that can barely be seen on the full size switch and those games are stupid small on this thing.  That is easily avoidable but the buttons are not.  Compared to the full size switch, all of the buttons feel mushy and cheap, especially the D-pad, it's atrocious.  I regret buying it rather than spending more and getting the ""good"" switch.  It's getting very dusty.  Also, the battery goes dead quickly when it's getting dusty."
1359,The controls will drift,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s a great product but with its poor build quality I can’t recommend it. The joycon is poorly designed and it will drift. The lite unlike the original, is a headache to repair. Stay away"
1360,Full of bugs and errors. Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nintendo is manipulating who wins their games in a biased way. Also, they make you pay monthly to play online and will ban you from online play if you leave a game before it's over. I will never buy a Nintendo system again."
1361,"Es una estafa, es un robo.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Me ha llegado la caja únicamente con el cargador y el manual, no me ha llegado la consola, estoy muy molesto por esta situación."
1362,Requires WiFi Not Portable,1.0 out of 5 stars,I strongly recommend AGAINST buying the Switch Lite. Downloaded content can only be played while connected to the internet.HUGE downside and problem since this is meant to be portable!!! . This item is USELESS.
1363,Price gouging.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Price gouger. Beware. Should be $199. Of people continue to pay these prices, their bot will continue to snatch up all the inventory and the vicious cycle continues."
1364,Not worth it unless you got money to burn,1.0 out of 5 stars,Remember they ask you for money every month! Pay my internet bill first! I bought you system plus a game I really shouldn't have to pay to use MY internet. Dose Nintendo pay my internet bill? No. So you shouldn't be able to make me pay to use my internet!
1365,Price gouging,1.0 out of 5 stars,I hope you spend the rest of your lives in jail and loose every cent you've ever made
1366,Too much money not the right price,1.0 out of 5 stars,To much for the Nintendo switch on tv it said 199.00 but on here is 200$ what a rip off
1367,BEWARE!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,Switch lites should ONLY BE $199 so if you see anything above that it’s price gouging.
1368,Not worth anything over 200,1.0 out of 5 stars,Report to amazon if its not 199.99 not paying a penny over that.
1369,Illegal to price gouge in a state of emergency,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is price gouging. I have exact same bundle, it sold for 200"
1370,Bad,1.0 out of 5 stars,Crap. Bad WiFi card and freezing right out of the box. Get your crap together Nintendo. Would not recommend.
1371,It sucks,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst console never buy this it absolutely sucks:/
1372,Ridiculous,1.0 out of 5 stars,Purchase somewhere else. They're getting shameless by overcharging. And it's USED?!?!
1373,Aaahhh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't know you had to set up a Nintendo account and does not include any preloaded games.Son lost interest
1374,Cancellation,1.0 out of 5 stars,I want to cancel my order
1375,Scratches on the screen... really?,1.0 out of 5 stars,The switch came with a scratched up screen... buyer beware.
1376,My favorite and only console!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a pc gamer but I had an interest in the switch after seeing the games coming out for it and the things you could do with it, but I didn't like how big and heavy it felt as i'm more of a walk around and play gamer since I do must of my gaming sitting down at my computer. I waited as people started talking about Nintendo having a plan of making a smaller version of the switch made me excited and here it finally is! well after amazon did me dirty even doe i pre ordered it months before it's release amazon gonna take my money right on the day it was supposed to come  on Friday September 27 I'm still salty about that but it's not Nintendo's fault so I wont mark down the review because of that.The things i love about this switch is that it's so light compared to the original as I held a friends one and I hated how it hurts my hands as I felt you had to play it either on the tv or table top mode but not with the lite. I could hold it for hours and not feel tired. I love how it literally fits into the pocket of my xl sweats as I can pull it out at any time I want. The screen is perfect even if it's smaller than the original. Your eyes can easily adjust and to me it feels better for pixel games or any games as they don't have to be stretched to fit the tv's screen as to me they look better on a smaller screen like they we're deigned for. I haven't had any joy stick drift on mine and the buttons feel nice and clicky to press. Same with the four directional pad. The Speakers sound nice and loud when audio is playing through them. It still has the micro sd slot and game cartridge slot and Headset jack on the console.My only problem with this thing is that I hate that the joycons don't come off. I was expected a mini version of the switch not a wii u game pad, but from what I read and seen on youtube videos it looks like it's an easy repair if you need to replace any parts out of it. The other thing I wish is that they still let you plug it into the tv. I know I said i like carrying it around but, I don't like playing on it while it's charging. Sometimes I wish I could dock it and keep playing as I get committed to the game i'm playing. Also when playing for a while I can feel the heat radiating on the back middle of the console. It's not too hot where it burns you and it's not damaging the console, but it's something you're going to notice when holding it.Overall this is my favorite and only console. I will probably be buying a stand and joycons to set up and play with some friends. I hope Nintendo keeps up the good work as to me in my eyes they are winning this console war hard."
1377,I love my switch lite and I’m happy I can finally play with my very own!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never owned a switch before, nevertheless a switch lite, so I’m no expert.However, the console has been working very nicely and in terms of quality of the product, shipping, and price it was a really good purchase!I really love the color in my switch, it’s just really vibrant and beautiful.I recommended buying the switch lite to people who want a less expensive version, and are fine without some abilities that the lite doesn’t have in contrary to the actual switch.It still does it’s job as switch console and plays the games I was looking towards playing. So I’m really happy with my switch lite!"
1378,Not really impressed,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Full disclosure: I have a full size switch.  The switch lite really pales in comparison to the regular switch, and it's not that much cheaper.  The screen isn't as vivid, it can't connect to the tv, I can't customize the joy cons, and overall it just feels cheaper in hand.  That being said, it plays all of the same games as the regular switch and does seem more durable since it's a solid piece of plastic, and for that reason I trust it more in the hands of my younger family members."
1379,Looking forward to the first downloads of CLASSICS!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived in good condition. Heard alot of cons about buying one but I’m an old-fashioned gameboy kid. I’m happy to have the switch elite and to be able to play the CLASSICS!
1380,Awesome But...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is so cool!! It's so small i can fit it in my pocket, . . . Barely. But the smaller screen doesn't make smaller text harder to read. (NOTICE) You MUST Be connected to Wifi if you want to play digital games unless you're playing on a Linked account. If your account is linked you can play any game digitally. Because my account is linked i am able to play Cuphead because it hasn't come out as a Game cartrige yet. Anyways. If you travel alot, Get the switch lite. If you stay at home, get the normal switch. I got the lite because it's Small, Portable, And it plays just as good as a Regular switch. However. You are ABSOLUTELY Unable to use the dock. You have to use the normal charger. But Do recommend to anyone looking for a good game at a cheap price."
1381,Glad I chose this one.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 10 year old wanted a switch. I was hesitant due to his lack of accountability and the price. This was a great choice. No lost joycons, though they are available to connect, and it has held up to his insistence on leaving it where it could be stepped on or sat on. I use it to relive the glory days of Donkey Kong and the visual quality of the screen is better than I expected. The device sized well so that it is comfortable for myself or my son to play. If you are not sure about a switch, I recommend the light."
1382,Can't play any games (UNDER INVESTIGATION),2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I finally had to ability to purchase a Nintendo Switch, I was super excited because I wanted to play the new Animal Crossing game. When it arrived I set up the system like normal and then purchased the said game. Then next thing I see is a completely white game. I can still interact with it like normal but I can't see my game at all. I sent this issue to Nintendo and its undergoing investigation. I originally thought the issue was just with Animal Crossing but when I downloaded another game for free, the same issue occurred. I don't know if there is an issue with my console itself, but I feel I wasted a good amount of money with this."
1383,Overrated,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was excited to get a nintendo switch, and when i received it, it was honestly disappointing. It felt like a cheaply made plastic console. It is slippery without a case on. I noticed the controls arent the best either and the sticks can drift here and there as well. It nice to have a portable gaming device, but it feels like the switch lite is just a cheap money grab."
1384,Grey Nintendo Switch Lite,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another great product fromNintendo. Perfect packaging from Amazon.
1385,Absolutely amazing!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"delivered on time, came in great condition and plays fantastically. I still love my original switch but this is another great system to add to my collection."
1386,love my switch lite!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got this to take to hotel when taking a rest after night shift in hospital. It was very light and easy to carry. mostly I love the color! I play animal crossing and I am already addicted to this game. I am going buy a Nintendo switch  later and will play it with my big tv .
1387,Perfect For Young Gamers,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is absolutely perfect for younger gamers. We added a case to house it and protect it from falls and I'm so very pleased by it. This is easy to charge and easy to take with you.  I love the color too.
1388,cost is ridiculous,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My grandson wanted this item, I ordered it thinking it was a game... but I quickly learned its nothing more than an expensive joystick. I actually found the Nintendo Console at a lower more reasonable price.  This went back."
1389,Sunflowers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously owned the Nintendo DS, but once I lost the charger, I eventually lost my interest for playing games too.Luckily, with my two favorite games: Animal Crossing and Cooking Mama coming to the Nintendo Switch, I knew that I had to get this!Along with this, I also purchased a decal on Etsy to make it more personalized.Overall, I am very happy with the Nintendo Switch Lite and I recommend it to anyone whose into gaming for leisurely purposes."
1390,Great,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this.  We have a reg switch but this is much better if they don’t have to share controllers
1391,Insane power in the palm of your hands.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing piece of tech. I never used the docking with my old switch and prefer handheld mode so this is perfect. The fact that I can play The Witcher 3 on the go is a testimate to this device.
1392,Switch lite is a great partner to regular switch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"absolutely LOVE the switch lite.  it has been great to play on the go and leaving my regular switch at the house.  I know the 1 account for 2 switches isn't very intuitive, but I had luck with making the lite my primary switch and then keeping my switch at home the secondary one.  The Home Switch will check online eveytime I launch a game but isn't a problem if it is always at home. 👍"
1393,I live for this thing lol,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got it for Animal Crossing. I play other games too, but I play ACNH every single day. People talk about drift issues with the joy cons on the full switch. But I've played every single day for like 7 months and have no issues!** had it for 8 months now, I'm definitely getting drift now 💔"
1394,Cute Coral Lite,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love this!! I waited so many months for the coral specifically. This is great because now my partner n I can play Animal Crossing together! (:

1398,Exactly what was advertised,5.0 out of 5 stars,The gray switch came well packaged with charger. It still works perfectly and it's been one of the best purchases I've made. I can't tell if it has any trouble running or storing too many games because all I play on it is Animal Crossing and What Remains of Edith Finch but it supports both of these games very well. The package also arrived a day early which was a nice surprise.
1399,🎮 Loveeee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived safe and sound :) super cute- I find the life to be wayyyyy more ergonomic than the original switch! Hours and hours of fun :)

1454,AWESOME,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this light weight switch!!! Couldn't be happier!!!!
1455,Happy with my purchase!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My boyfriend bought me a switch! I had no problem with it but you should know a few things before buying. If you’re buying the switch to play with friends or your partner (which is what I did), you have to pay for online. Which is not that bad, I paid $8 for 3 months. You also don’t have to go out of your way to buy the games before receiving it (which is what I did lol). There’s an E-store where you can buy every single game. I prefer that option so you don’t have to look and worry to see if it’s compatible with switch lite. They also got free games if you can afford none. The only down side is that it did took a while to download. By the time I got out the shower, only one game downloaded. The audio kinda sucks ngl. I’m playing minecraft and (full volume) I could barely hear the music, and I love peaceful minecraft music so that sucks. Also get ready to sign in to every game you have!This other part is about Amazon,When I bought it, the next day Amazon refunded my money and canceled the order which was very weird but I didn’t say much about it. Two days later they took the money again. The delivery took forever! By the time it was delivered to the lockers, it was 8pm. I still got my items so it doesn’t matter."
1456,"Fun, fun, fun",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, came quickly! Small but super sharp display, with NOT to be used with t.v. !!  Portable device which is great for taking on the go, no complaints from me."
1457,Speedy delivery and good price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for Grandson in Ireland , He was very pleased with it and was a great gift A++"
1458,"Love it! only downside is it doesn't come with a usb-c to HDMI cable, or a dock for that matter.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always had a special place in my heart for Nintendo, I mean I love my PS4 and my Xbox one, but when it comes to playing fun multiplayer couch co-ops or some Mario kart with the family at family gatherings, or some good old fashioned smash bros. Animal crossing or Pokemon the Nintendo's the only place you're going to get some of those modern yet nostalgic titles. I still have my original switch, just bought the light to compare mainly! Controllers don't come off the sides, no usb-c to HDMI cable included, and no dock."

1472,I've never loved a inanimate object but...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The switch is an amazing console with plenty of games but, most of all, convenient!I love the customization options, I feel like such a kid while playing this; lol it's great!My biggest criticisms are the confusion between the switch and the lite, not a lot is made clear and it feels like you have access to more games than are really meant to be compatible with the lite. For example: any sports related titles, or ones with more than one player required, are still available to purchase even though they require joycons...If you keep this in mind-- that the lite is meant for SOLO play, you'll be fine!Regardless of those limitations it still has the same performance as the regular switch as far as I can tell..."

Color selection was great, fits perfectly in your hands, plus you can bling it up to make it snazzy with different cases and joy con covers.
